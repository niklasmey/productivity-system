Making it official: I'm going all-in on MOMENTUM!

Earlier this year, I had to admit failure at yet another tech start-up.

Not a stranger to risk and commitment, I knew I needed to be more systematic and independent going forward.

So I quickly focused on mastering vibe-coding, community-building, and idea validation.

At the same time, it was invigorating to see the surge of builder enthusiasm right now.

It's almost trite to say, but with AI, literally anyone can now build tech products!

Yet I kept seeing builders face the same struggles going from idea to real-life impact, I faced multiple times in the last 4 years.

That's when I started a community project adjacent to Lovable shipped and other vibe-coding challenges.

After serving 4 cohorts and 40+ builders, it evolved into MOMENTUM.

MOMENTUM is an indie accelerator that reminds people of their human potential.

The goal is to help anyone turn a personal pain point, deep domain expertise, or zone of genius into a path toward personal freedom.

It pairs peer communities with my German-engineered system to test ideas 0-1.

Sitting on an idea? Been asked to innovate with AI? Outgrown your current job? Let's build together!
