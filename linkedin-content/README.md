# LinkedIn Content System for MOMENTUM

A simple system for creating high-performing LinkedIn content with Claude Code AI assistance.

**Goal**: Drive 12-16 quality applications per MOMENTUM cohort through authentic storytelling + tactical value.

---

## How It Works

1. **Fill out context files once** ([MOMENTUM.md](context/MOMENTUM.md) + [strategy.md](context/strategy.md))
2. **Paste drafts in Claude Code** → Get AI-powered suggestions
3. **Iterate in real-time** → Line-by-line editing with full context
4. **Score before publishing** → Use rubric to ensure quality
5. **Track performance** → Learn what drives applications

No Python, no CLI, no complexity. Just context + conversation + tracking.

## Content Strategy at a Glance

### Target: 5 posts/week (Mon-Fri)

**Content Pillars**:
1. **Founder Journey** (30%) → Vulnerable stories, pivots, failures
2. **MOMENTUM Program** (25%) → Cohort launches, case studies, urgency
3. **Building Frameworks** (25%) → Rule of Two, vibe-coding, tactical systems
4. **Lifestyle & Embodiment** (20%) → Morning routines, taste, personal growth

### Success Metrics:
- **Primary**: 12-16 applications per cohort
- **Secondary**: Quality DM conversations with ideal participants
- **Tertiary**: Engagement from fellow builders (not vanity metrics)

### What Works:
- ✅ Vulnerable founder journey posts
- ✅ Tactical frameworks with numbers (Rule of Two, 7 hacks)
- ✅ Cohort launches with urgency (limited spots, dates)
- ✅ Authentic voice (warm, confident, slightly edgy)

### What to Avoid:
- ❌ Generic inspiration without story
- ❌ Over-technical jargon
- ❌ Salesy posts without value first
- ❌ Promoting Cocoony (unless as backstory)

## Tips for Success

**Voice**:

- Use your phrases: "vibe-coding", "German-engineered system", "messy middle"
- Avoid LinkedIn clichés: "synergy", "thought leader", "hustle culture"

**Hook**:
- First 7 words must stop the scroll
- Use numbers, emotions, or contrarian statements
- Specific > generic always

**Story**:
- Problem → Journey → Insight → Outcome
- Include vulnerable moments
- Concrete examples (not abstractions)

**MOMENTUM Integration**:
- Value first, offer second
- Natural solution to pain mentioned
- Create urgency with cohort dates and limited spots

**CTA**:
- One clear, low-friction next step
- Personal ("DM me" not "contact us")
- Time-sensitive when appropriate

## How Claude Will Help You

When you paste a draft, Claude will automatically:

1. **Read all context** (MOMENTUM.md, strategy.md, past posts)
2. **Understand your voice** (14 posts analyzed)
3. **Know your goals** (drive applications to MOMENTUM)

You just paste and ask. Claude does the heavy lifting.

## Remember

**The content that converts isn't the most polished—it's the most authentic.**

Your superpower: Vulnerable storytelling + tactical systems.

When you combine both (story + framework), that's when magic happens.

**Your best post makes a founder at 2am think:**
> "This person gets exactly what I'm going through. I need to join MOMENTUM."
