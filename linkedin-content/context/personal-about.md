# Niklas Mey - Personal About Section

I'm Nik, and I care about bringing people together and reducing waste, especially of human potential.

I've built from scratch more times than I can count, and made a career out of failing forward. And I LOVE it! It's where all the growth happens.

After facing the same struggles going from idea to real-world impact across multiple startups, I created MOMENTUM.

MOMENTUM is an indie accelerator that reminds people of their human potential.

The goal is to help anyone turn a personal pain point, deep domain expertise, or zone of genius into a path toward personal freedom.

Sitting on an idea? Been asked to innovate with AI? Outgrown your current job? Let's build together!
The next cohort starts Nov 17.

It's a 5-week sprint where 10 founders, intrapreneurs, and career changers say YES to one of their ideas and to building alongside each other!
