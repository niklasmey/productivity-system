Let me remind you of your human potential.

I'm Nik and if you're like me, you've got dreams you aren't living, ideas you haven't built, and moves you haven't made.

And that's just what you can imagine right now!

But getting there requires courage, creativity, and bold actions!

And that's where I got stuck in the past:
- I kept pushing my dreams into the future;
- I waited for someone else to give me permission
- And, I gave into easy excuses to protect my ego

Building solo kept me struggling with my patterns.

Knowing community is the answer, I started hosting 5-week long sprints for a group of peers who say YES to one of their ideas and to building alongside each other.

After four cohorts it turned into MOMENTUM, a proven vehicle for founders, intrapreneurs, and career changers to make undeniable progress together.

Through workshops, coworking sessions, and personal guidance, I provide the structure.

The group fills it with sharp feedback and real support.

Together, we turn dreams into MOMENTUM!

But let's hear from the people themselves:

[TESTIMONIAL CLIPS]

Real people with real breakthroughs in just 5 weeks.

So, what about you? Where do you wanna be by the end of the year?

Imagine what becomes possible when you build with MOMENTUM!

Join our next cohort, starting Nov 17.

Looking forward to building with you!

## Key Messaging Themes

1. **Human potential** - Opening hook addressing universal struggle
2. **Personal vulnerability** - Nik's own pattern struggles (permission, excuses, ego)
3. **Solo → Community shift** - Core insight that building alone = stuck
4. **Proven track record** - Four cohorts, multiple personas (founders, intrapreneurs, career changers)
5. **Structure + Support formula** - Nik provides framework, group provides energy
6. **Social proof** - Testimonial clips showing "real breakthroughs"
7. **Future-pacing CTA** - "Where do you wanna be by end of year?"

## Landing Page Integration Notes

- Place video prominently in hero section
- Video should autoplay (muted) or have compelling thumbnail
- Add caption: "Watch Nik's story and why MOMENTUM works"
- Include transcript link for accessibility
- Mobile: Ensure responsive sizing, easy tap-to-play
