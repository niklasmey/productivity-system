## The 3-Minute Check

### ✅ Content Quality

**Hook** (first 7 words)
- [ ] Stops the scroll immediately
- [ ] Specific number, emotion, OR contrarian statement
- [ ] Avoids generic openings like "I want to talk about..."

**Story/Value**
- [ ] Clear arc or framework
- [ ] Vulnerable OR tactical (ideally both)
- [ ] Specific examples (not abstract concepts)
- [ ] Sounds like me (not corporate LinkedIn voice)

**Audience**
- [ ] Will resonate with founders/builders
- [ ] Addresses their real pain or aspiration
- [ ] Makes them think "this is me" or "I need this"

**MOMENTUM Integration**
- [ ] Naturally mentions MOMENTUM (when appropriate)
- [ ] OR sets up for future MOMENTUM posts
- [ ] Value first, offer second
- [ ] Not forced or salesy

**CTA**
- [ ] Clear, specific next step
- [ ] Low-friction (DM me > link > form)
- [ ] Personal tone ("DM me" not "contact us")
- [ ] Creates urgency when appropriate

---

### ✅ Formatting & Polish

**Line Breaks**
- [ ] Break every 1-2 sentences MAX
- [ ] No walls of text
- [ ] Scannable on mobile (check!)

**Visual Elements**
- [ ] Bullets (• or →) where helpful
- [ ] Unicode bold (𝐁𝐎𝐋𝐃) for subheadings (not overused)
- [ ] 🔥 emoji if urgency/energy post
- [ ] Numbers in digits (7, not seven)

**Length**
- [ ] 500-1000 words for storytelling/frameworks
- [ ] 300 words for lifestyle/hot takes
- [ ] Not too long (1500+ usually overkill)
- [ ] Not too short (under 200 feels incomplete)

---

### ✅ Technical Checks

**Proofread**
- [ ] No typos or grammatical errors
- [ ] No awkward phrases
- [ ] Re-read out loud (does it flow?)

**Mobile Check**
- [ ] View on phone before posting
- [ ] Formatting looks good on mobile
- [ ] Line breaks work on small screen

**Links** (if any)
- [ ] Don't put links IN post body (LinkedIn penalizes)
- [ ] Put link in first comment if needed
- [ ] Explain what link is for

---

### ✅ Strategic Alignment

**Goal Check**
- [ ] Does this drive toward cohort applications?
- [ ] Does this build trust with target audience?
- [ ] Does this differentiate me/MOMENTUM?

**Content Pillar**
- [ ] Fits within one of 4 pillars (Founder Journey, MOMENTUM, Framework, Lifestyle)
- [ ] Maintains pillar balance this week

**Timing**
- [ ] Good time to post (6-8am, 12-1pm, or 5-7pm PT)
- [ ] Not conflicting with other recent posts
- [ ] Appropriate for day of week

---

### ✅ Brand Guardrails

**Voice**
- [ ] Sounds like me (warm, confident, slightly edgy)
- [ ] Uses my phrases naturally ("vibe-coding", "messy middle", "failing forward")
- [ ] Avoids LinkedIn clichés ("synergy", "thought leader", "hustle")

**Don'ts Check**
- [ ] NOT promoting Cocoony (unless as backstory)
- [ ] NOT over-promising ("guaranteed success")
- [ ] NOT too technical (alienating non-technical)
- [ ] NOT positioning as guru (fellow builder instead)

**Messaging**
- [ ] Aligns with MOMENTUM positioning
- [ ] Consistent with past posts
- [ ] Reinforces key themes (personal freedom, community, 0-1 validation)

---

## Final Gut Check

**Ask yourself**:

1. **Would I share this?**
   - If you saw this from another builder, would you share it with your network?
   - ☐ Yes → Good sign
   - ☐ No → What's missing?

2. **Does it sound like me?**
   - If someone read this without seeing the name, would they know it's you?
   - ☐ Yes → Voice is strong
   - ☐ No → Add more personality

3. **Will it start conversations?**
   - Will people comment with their own stories, not just "great post"?
   - ☐ Yes → Engagement gold
   - ☐ No → Add vulnerability or ask better questions

4. **Does it serve my goal?**
   - Does this move the needle toward filling the next cohort?
   - ☐ Yes → Aligned
   - ☐ No → Reconsider or adjust

## Common Last-Minute Fixes

### Weak Hook?

- Add vulnerability
- More specific examples
- Remove fluff

### CTA Unclear?
- One specific action only
- Make it personal ("DM me" not "contact us")
- Add urgency if appropriate
- **Before**: "What do you think?"
- **After**: "DM me to join the waitlist for the Nov 17 cohort"

### Formatting Dense?

## Post-Publish Actions

After hitting "Post":

**Immediate** (within 5 minutes):
- [ ] Reply to any early comments
- [ ] Share to relevant groups (if appropriate)
- [ ] Pin to profile if it's a key post

**First Hour**:
- [ ] Monitor comments
- [ ] Reply to everyone who engages
- [ ] Start conversations (ask follow-ups)

**First 24 Hours**:
- [ ] Move meaningful conversations to DMs
- [ ] Thank people who share
- [ ] Engage with those who tag friends

**48 Hours After**:
- [ ] Log metrics in POST_TRACKING.md
- [ ] Note what worked/didn't
- [ ] Track DMs/applications generated

---

## Batch Publishing Prep

If you're scheduling/batching posts:

**Monday**:
- [ ] Week's content drafted
- [ ] All passed checklist
- [ ] Scheduled or queued

**Daily**:
- [ ] Review scheduled post one more time
- [ ] Make any last tweaks
- [ ] Publish manually (better engagement than auto-post)

---

## Emergency Stop

**DON'T PUBLISH IF**:

- ❌ You're not proud of it
- ❌ It doesn't sound like you
- ❌ Scores under 60
- ❌ Written while emotional/reactive
- ❌ Conflicts with brand values
- ❌ Promotes wrong thing (Cocoony, etc.)
- ❌ Over-promises or feels salesy

**Better to skip a day than publish something off-brand.**

---

## Remember

- Quality > Quantity (always)
- Vulnerable storytelling + tactical systems = magic
- Lead with value, follow with offer
- Your best post makes a founder at 2am think: "This person gets me. I need to join MOMENTUM."

**Now go post that fire content! 🔥**
