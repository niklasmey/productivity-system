63 Founding Members are already co-creating an AI shopping companion with me!

I talked to thousands of online shoppers who waste 17 hours and $320 every year on sizing mistakes alone.

They all felt "That's ME" when I asked:

→ Have you ever had 20+ tabs open just to buy one shirt?
→ Have you ever regretted a purchase right after checkout?
→ Have you ever returned something you ordered in the wrong size?

As a 30-year-old builder, I lived through this frustration too many times.

Refusing to accept it as normal, I built the fix we all needed.

Called a "life saver for GenZ," it's an AI that matches you to real people with your body type and fit challenges.

It's trained on 100,000+ Reddit comments, TikTok fit checks, and YouTube try-on hauls.

You create your fit profile once, and know what size will fit every time!

94% accuracy with zero measurements, body scans, and selfies.

Just the largest database of real-person fit data, working for you.

Get one-click size predictions, then chat about any fit, style, or sizing questions before you click "buy."

Here's what the first 100 Founding Members get:
→ Shape the brands we drop and features we build next
→ Get immediate access to Aritzia size suggestions
→ Enjoy free lifetime access to the full product

Once we hit 100 Founding Members, we're closing the group and will focus on growing our waitlist to 10k.

This is for the people who are done with sizing anxiety, want to know it'll fit before they buy, and help make this possible for everyone.
