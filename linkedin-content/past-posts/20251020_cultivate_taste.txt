I listened to all the Apple Music 100 Best Albums to cultivate TASTE! 🔥

If AI lets me build anything now, what's actually worth building?

Knowing taste is the answer, I've developed a system to cultivate mine.

And, the single most effective practice?

Listening to new music albums front to back without multitasking or distractions.

Using Apple Music's 100 Best Albums as my program and Perplexity to deep-dive into the artist's life and cultural impact, I've studied:

• 60 years of music, ranging from timeless classics to recent hits
• Genres like hip-hop, rock, jazz, folk, punk, and numerous others
• Work from 50 Cent, David Bowie, Billie Eilish, SZA, and more

Through samples, callbacks, and new genres, I saw how musical ideas bounce off each other and amplify over decades.

Cultural trends and zeitgeist moments became much easier to spot, helping me anticipate what's about to peak.

And I learned how storytelling works through soundscapes alone, enabling me to identify sounds that catch people's attention.

If listening to 100 albums feels like a lot, here are the 7 albums I'd start with:
• A Love Supreme | John Coltrane
• Confessions | USHER
• Homogenic | Björk
• Blue Lines | Massive Attack
• Are You Experienced | Jimi Hendrix
• Horses | Patti Smith
• Trans-Europe Express | Kraftwerk

Lastly, I found it's best to do this as part of an extended lunch break.

11 out of 10 recommend! 👌
