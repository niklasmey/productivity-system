## Performance Insights (Updated Nov 2024)

### Top Performers by Score:
1. **Getting Hired Playbook** (88/100) - Framework + Story + Vulnerability = GOLD
2. **Cocoony Sunset** (82/100) - Best hook but weak CTA hurt performance
3. **Cohort 4 Announcement** (78/100) - Story-first approach wins
4. **Morning Routine** (76/100) - Lifestyle + structure = strong reach
5. **Free Goal Setting** (75/100) - Strong offer, underperformed

### What Works:
- **Framework + Personal Story + Vulnerability** (Getting Hired: 1,300 impressions, 12 comments)
- **Lifestyle + Structure** (Morning Routine: 2,000 impressions, 4 comments)
- **Vulnerable Founder Journey** (Cocoony Sunset: Best hook 25/25)
- **Profile Updates** (MOMENTUM announcement: 5x reach boost)
- **Story-First Cohort Launches** (1,600 vs 600 impressions)

### What Doesn't Work:
- **List Posts Without Story** (Vibe-coding hacks: 3,100 impressions, 0 comments - passive consumption)
- **Comment Hacks** (75VIBES: Forced engagement = lowest score 58/100)
- **Weak CTAs** (Best hooks underperform without clear next step)
- **Off-Brand Content** (Cocoony product posts during MOMENTUM pivot)
- **Pure Offers Without Story** (Feature lists underperform vs narrative)

### Winning Formula:
1. Hook with emotion + specific outcome
2. Vulnerable personal story (failing forward)
3. Clear framework or system
4. Natural MOMENTUM tie-in
5. Strong CTA (DM me to join Nov 17 cohort)

### Content Mix Recommendation:
- **40%** Framework + Personal Story (Getting hired format)
- **30%** MOMENTUM/Cohort content (with story, not features)
- **20%** Lifestyle/Process (morning routine, behind-the-scenes)
- **10%** Hot takes (drive comments strategically)

### Average Score: 71/100
**Goal**: Consistently hit 75+ with occasional 85+ bangers
