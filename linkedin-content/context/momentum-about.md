# MOMENTUM - Official About

MOMENTUM is an indie accelerator that reminds people of their human potential.

The goal is to help anyone turn a personal pain point, deep domain expertise, or zone of genius into a path toward personal freedom.

It pairs peer communities with our German-engineered system to test ideas 0-1.

Sitting on an idea? Been asked to innovate with AI? Outgrown your current job? Let's build together!

The next cohort of our flagship program starts Nov 17.

It's a 5-week sprint where 10 founders, intrapreneurs, and career changers say YES to one of their ideas and to building alongside each other!
