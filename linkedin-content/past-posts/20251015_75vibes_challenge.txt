Everyone is doing 75𝐇𝐀𝐑𝐃 right now. I'm doing 75𝐕𝐈𝐁𝐄𝐒 instead!
Look, mental toughness and healthy bodies are the foundation.
But I'm asking myself what's next in the pursuit of greatness and personal freedom?

So, I came up with 75𝐕𝐈𝐁𝐄𝐒 to help us master the craft of:
• Creating better products
• Reaching more people
• Amplifying our impact

Here are the rules:
#1 Follow a highly curated content diet
#2 Vibe-code for at least 60min
#3 Build community for at least 60min
#4 Workout for at least 45min (intense/outdoors)
#5 Practice stillness for at least 30min (e.g., do nothing, breathwork, etc.)
#6 Journal on your progress

Fine print:
• 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 > 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧! Keep going even if you miss a rule. Your goal is to build momentum.
• A healthy diet, 2.5L of water daily, and no alcohol/cheats are encouraged
• You practice stillness to tap into your intuition and unlock your taste
• You've got until you go to sleep to complete the day

Comment "75VIBES" and I'll send you a vibe-coded tracker.

Share your progress using hashtag#75VIBES to inspire the community.

Time to propel yourself to the next level! 🔥

P.S. Built the entire 75VIBES tracker with Lovable in 3hrs, including frontend, backend, user auth, and organic growth.
