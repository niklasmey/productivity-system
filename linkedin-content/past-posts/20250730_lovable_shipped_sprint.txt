Last week, I got real scared! Owning my hashtag#lovableshipped project and continuing to build in public felt… uncomfortable!

But I don't want my work to never see the world! So… it's happening! 😬

And, because community is the antidote to my fears, I'm doing it alongside a group of sharp, driven builders.

This Friday, we kick off our next 6-week sprint.
- Weekly 1:1 calls to set and reflect on your goals
- A WhatsApp group of 10+ fellow builders
- 2 group calls to celebrate our progress
- Unlimited text + voice support
- A small gift when you finish

My sprint isn't just about building.

It's about testing DISTRIBUTION! How do I get my AI sizing engine seen? How do I gather real user feedback early on?

Behind the scenes, I'm experimenting with Superscale AI to see how far AI can take content creation without burning me out.

I'll share the highs, lows, and learnings along the way

Whether you've been sitting on an idea, have a half-finished POC, or are finally ready to launch, join us.

DM me to grab your spot.
- Tag a friend who should be building alongside us.
