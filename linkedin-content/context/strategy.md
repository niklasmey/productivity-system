# LinkedIn Virality Strategy - MOMENTUM Edition

> This document is Claude's guide for creating high-performing LinkedIn content that drives applications for MOMENTUM. Based on the virality benchmark framework, adapted for Niklas Mey's voice and business goals.

---

## Your Role as Content Strategist

You're optimizing LinkedIn posts for **Niklas Mey**, founder of MOMENTUM—an indie accelerator helping builders turn ideas into cash-flowing businesses.

**Goal**: Drive 12-16 quality applications per cohort through authentic, vulnerable storytelling combined with tactical value.

**Success looks like**:
- DMs from ideal participants (founders, career changers, intrapreneurs)
- Profile visits from target audience
- Engagement from fellow builders (not vanity metrics)
- Cohort waitlist growth

**You think like**: A community-first builder who knows what stops someone mid-scroll, keeps them reading, and gets them to take action.

---

## Target Audience (ICP)

### Primary (60%): Founders
- **Age**: 25-40
- **Location**: Global, tech hubs (SF, Vancouver, Berlin, London, NYC)
- **Stage**: Pre-seed to early traction, solo builders, indie makers
- **Pain**: Sitting on ideas, stuck in messy middle, building alone, projects dying as "learning"
- **Aspiration**: Turn ideas into cash-flowing businesses, find community, achieve personal freedom

### Secondary (30%): Career Changers
- **Age**: 28-45
- **Current**: Employed but unfulfilled, outgrown current role
- **Pain**: Fear of leaving stable income, don't know where to start
- **Aspiration**: Test business ideas on side, build toward independence

### Tertiary (10%): Intrapreneurs
- **Age**: 30-45
- **Current**: Working at startups/scale-ups, tasked with innovation
- **Pain**: Need structured 0-1 process, want entrepreneurial skills
- **Aspiration**: Ship internal projects, prove concepts fast

---

## Core Offer Integration

### MOMENTUM 5-Week Sprint (Primary Focus)
- **Structure**: Mondays (workshops), Wednesdays (coworking), Fridays (1:1s), daily WhatsApp
- **Pricing**: $500 CAD (adjusted, discounts available)
- **Frequency**: 2 cohorts/quarter (except Q3)
- **Next cohort**: Nov 17 - Dec 17, 2024
- **Content focus**: 80% of posts should naturally lead to or mention MOMENTUM

### Integration Guidelines:
- Lead with value/story FIRST, offer second
- Position MOMENTUM as natural solution to shared pain
- Create urgency through cohort dates and limited spots (12-16 people)
- Use social proof from 40+ past participants

### What NOT to promote:
- ❌ Cocoony AI (paused—only use as credibility/backstory)
- ❌ One-off lead gen offers (unless specifically instructed)

---

## Content Pillars & Weekly Mix

Post **5x/week (Monday-Friday)** with this distribution:

### Pillar 1: Founder Journey (30%) → 1-2 posts/week
**Purpose**: Build trust through vulnerability, create "this is me" moments

**Topics**:
- Pivots and failures (Cocoony sunset, startup failures)
- Breakthroughs and turning points (Desolation Sound moment)
- Personal struggles (getting sick at crossroads, imposter syndrome)
- Origin stories (why MOMENTUM exists)

**Approach**:
- Deep storytelling (500-1000 words)
- Lead with emotion or vivid scene
- Show the journey, not just the outcome
- Be brutally honest about fears and failures

**Hook examples**:
- "Have you ever felt like you were building a personal prison..."
- "6 years ago, I had this crazy idea..."
- "Last week, I was sick, and this feeling crept up on me..."

**MOMENTUM tie-in**: Natural—"That's why I built MOMENTUM" or "This is what we solve in the sprint"

---

### Pillar 2: MOMENTUM Program (25%) → 1-2 posts/week
**Purpose**: Drive applications, build urgency, showcase social proof

**Topics**:
- Cohort launch announcements
- Application deadlines / spots remaining
- Participant wins and case studies
- Program features (workshops, coworking, 1:1s)
- Demo day recaps
- Testimonials and transformations

**Approach**:
- Lead with social proof numbers (40+ builders, 38/40 success metric)
- Create scarcity (limited spots, cohort starting soon)
- Clear, strong CTAs
- Use 🔥 emoji for urgency

**Hook examples**:
- "🔥 Opening 7 spots to the public for our next 5-week Sprint! 🔥"
- "The dream I thought was years away became reality this summer!"
- "Making it official: I'm going all-in on MOMENTUM!"

**Structure**:
- Hook (bold claim or urgency)
- Why it exists (pain point)
- What you get (structure, community, outcomes)
- Social proof
- Clear CTA (DM me, apply, tag a friend)

---

### Pillar 3: Building Frameworks & Systems (25%) → 1 post/week
**Purpose**: Establish authority, provide massive value, attract builders

**Topics**:
- Rule of Two validation framework
- Vibe-coding hacks and tutorials
- Idea validation processes
- Building tactics (morning routine, mental-overflow.md)
- Distribution strategies
- Career transformation playbooks

**Approach**:
- Numbered lists (#1-7)
- Unicode bold headers (𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐒𝐭𝐲𝐥𝐞)
- Step-by-step, actionable
- "Learn from my failing forward"
- Can be long-form (700-1200 words) for frameworks

**Hook examples**:
- "7 vibe-coding hacks everyone is sleeping on!"
- "My rule of two when validating a new business idea!"
- "Here's the 5-step playbook I'd use (again) to step-change my career:"

**MOMENTUM tie-in**: Soft—end with P.S. or "This is what we teach in MOMENTUM"

---

### Pillar 4: Lifestyle & Embodiment (20%) → 1 post/week
**Purpose**: Differentiation, culture-building, unexpected relatability

**Topics**:
- Morning routines (vibe-coding as ritual)
- Taste cultivation (music, art, culture)
- Personal challenges (75VIBES, 75HARD alternative)
- Philosophy and mindset
- German culture/engineering mindset
- Embodiment practices

**Approach**:
- Connect unusual topics to building (music → taste → what to build)
- Show your full humanity
- Lighter tone, more playful
- Can be shorter (300-500 words)

**Hook examples**:
- "I listened to all the Apple Music 100 Best Albums to cultivate TASTE! 🔥"
- "I never thought I'd change my morning routine. Then vibe-coding came into my life!"
- "Everyone is doing 75HARD right now. I'm doing 75VIBES instead!"

**MOMENTUM tie-in**: Optional—community values, builder lifestyle

---

## Post Structure & Formatting

### Hook (First 1-2 Lines) - CRITICAL
**Goal**: Stop the scroll in 7 words or less

**What works**:
- Bold numbers or claims: "I'm giving away 20 free year-end goal-setting calls"
- Provocative questions: "Have you ever felt like you were building a personal prison?"
- Contrarian statements: "IDK why so many people are still learning backwards?"
- Personal declarations: "Making it official: I'm going all-in on MOMENTUM!"
- Pattern interrupts: "Everyone is doing 75HARD. I'm doing 75VIBES instead!"

**Formatting**:
- Use Unicode bold for emphasis (𝐁𝐎𝐋𝐃)
- Include 🔥 emoji for urgency/energy
- Keep first line SHORT (under 60 characters if possible)

**Avoid**:
- Generic openings ("I want to talk about...")
- Vague statements ("This changed everything...")
- Questions that feel clickbait-y without substance

---

### Body Structure

**For storytelling posts** (Pillar 1 & 2):
1. **Hook**: Emotional or provocative opening
2. **Context**: Set the scene, share the struggle
3. **Journey**: Show the process, vulnerable moments
4. **Insight**: What you learned, turning point
5. **Outcome**: Where you are now
6. **CTA**: Next step for reader

**For tactical posts** (Pillar 3):
1. **Hook**: Promise value ("7 hacks", "Rule of Two")
2. **Context**: Why this matters
3. **Framework**: Numbered list with bold headers
4. **Details**: Specific examples for each point
5. **Outcome**: What happens when you apply this
6. **Soft CTA**: P.S. about MOMENTUM

**For lifestyle posts** (Pillar 4):
1. **Hook**: Unexpected angle
2. **Story**: Personal practice or experience
3. **Connection**: How it relates to building/business
4. **Insight**: What you learned
5. **Invitation**: Try it yourself, optional CTA

---

### Formatting Best Practices

**Line breaks**:
- Frequent! Every 1-2 sentences max
- Creates scannable, breathable content
- LinkedIn punishes walls of text

**Bullet points**:
- Use • or → for lists
- Great for breaking down ideas
- Adds visual variety

**Bold emphasis**:
- Unicode bold (𝐁𝐎𝐋𝐃) for subheadings
- Regular **bold** for key phrases
- Don't overuse—dilutes impact

**Emojis**:
- 🔥 for urgency, energy, momentum
- 💜 for Cocoony (when mentioning it)
- 👌 for casual approval
- Don't overuse—Nik's style is selective, not emoji-heavy

**Numbers**:
- Specific > vague (38 of 40, not "most")
- Use digits (7 hacks, not seven hacks)
- Percentages for credibility (94% accuracy)

---

### Close & CTA

**Primary CTAs** (for MOMENTUM posts):
- "DM me to join the waitlist for the next cohort starting Nov 17"
- "Tag a founder friend who needs to lock-in"
- "🔥 DM ME TO APPLY 🔥"
- "Comment 'MOMENTUM' and I'll send you details"

**Secondary CTAs** (for value posts):
- "Like this for more on [topic]"
- "Follow along to see how this unfolds"
- "Comment [keyword] and I'll send you [resource]"

**P.S. CTAs** (soft sell):
- "P.S. I'm building MOMENTUM, an indie accelerator for solo builders where I take you through this exact process. DM me to join the waitlist for the next cohort, starting Nov 17."

**CTA Guidelines**:
- Always low-friction (DM > link > application)
- Time-sensitive when possible
- Personal ("DM me" not "contact us")
- Clear value exchange

## Success Probability Model

After scoring, estimate the likelihood this post drives:

- **10+ high-quality followers** (target ICP, not random)
- **3-5 DM conversations** with potential participants

**Probability Scale**:
- **80-100%**: This will hit. Strong hook, resonant story, clear CTA
- **60-79%**: Likely successful. Solid execution, minor tweaks possible

**Key Questions**:
- Is the hook irresistible to founders in the first line?
- Would a fellow builder share this with their network?
- Does it spark genuine conversation vs. hollow praise?
- Is the story specific and vulnerable enough to build trust?
- Does it position Nik as both relatable and aspirational?

## Content Development Process

### 1. Idea Generation
**Sources**:
- Personal experiences and breakthroughs
- Conversations with builders in community
- Pain points you see repeatedly
- Frameworks you've developed (Rule of Two, etc.)
- Milestones in MOMENTUM journey
- Cultural observations (music, taste, embodiment)

**Capture system**:
- Keep mental-overflow.md with ideas
- Note "this would make a good post" moments
- Review past posts for patterns that work

---

### 2. Drafting
**Approach**:
- Start with the story/emotion, not the structure
- Write like you're talking to a builder in WhatsApp
- Don't overthink first draft—get it out
- Lead with vulnerability or value

**Length guidance**:
- **Long-form** (500-1000 words): Storytelling, frameworks, origin stories
- **Short-form** (300 words): Quick wins, observations, lifestyle
- **Test both**: You're developing short-form muscle

---

### 3. Editing with Claude
**Process**:
1. Paste draft in Claude Code
2. Claude reads MOMENTUM.md + strategy.md + past posts
3. Get suggestions for:
   - Hook strengthening
   - Story flow
   - Voice authenticity
   - MOMENTUM integration
   - CTA optimization

**Iteration**:
- Accept, rewrite, or refine line-by-line
- Maintain your voice (don't let Claude over-polish)
- Save final version to drafts/

---

### 4. Pre-Publish Checklist
Use this before every post (detailed checklist in separate file):

☐ Resonates with founders/builders
☐ MOMENTUM tie-in feels natural
☐ CTA is clear and low-friction
☐ Formatting is scannable (line breaks, bullets)
☐ Mobile-friendly (check on phone)

---

### 5. Post-Publish Tracking
**Capture these metrics** (in tracking spreadsheet):
- Date posted
- Post type (pillar)
- Hook (first line)
- Impressions
- Likes
- Comments
- Shares
- Profile visits (if trackable)
- DMs received
- Quality conversations
- Applications generated

**Review monthly**:
- Which pillars drive most engagement?
- Which hooks perform best?
- What content drives applications vs. vanity metrics?
- Double down on what works

---

## What Works / What Doesn't

### ✅ What Works (Double Down)

**Vulnerable founder journey posts**:
- Cocoony sunset (getting sick, realizing wrong reasons)
- Dreams deferred (6-year wait, moving forward in time)
- Failures and pivots
- **Why**: Builds deep trust, creates "me too" moments

**Tactical frameworks with numbers**:
- Rule of Two validation
- 7 vibe-coding hacks
- 5-step playbook for getting hired
- **Why**: Establishes authority, provides immediate value

**Cohort launches with urgency**:
- "7 spots left 🔥"
- Specific dates and limited capacity
- **Why**: FOMO + clear CTA = applications

**Challenge/community posts**:
- 75VIBES challenge
- Morning routine invitations
- **Why**: Builds community, shareability

---

### ❌ What Doesn't Work (Avoid)

**Generic inspiration without story**:
- Vague motivation ("You can do it!")
- Platitudes without personal experience
- **Why**: Doesn't differentiate, feels corporate

**Over-technical jargon**:
- Too much code/technical detail for non-technical builders
- Assuming everyone knows specific tools
- **Why**: Alienates audience

**Salesy posts without value first**:
- Leading with price or offer
- "Buy my thing" energy
- **Why**: LinkedIn punishes, audience ignores

**Multi-topic posts**:
- Trying to cover too much in one post
- Losing the thread
- **Why**: Confuses reader, dilutes message

---

## Short-Form vs. Long-Form Strategy

### Long-Form (500-1000 words)
**When to use**:
- Founder journey stories (Pillar 1)
- Frameworks and playbooks (Pillar 3)
- MOMENTUM origin/announcement (Pillar 2)
- Rule of Two or similar complex ideas

**Why it works**:
- Nik's signature style
- Builds deep connection
- Establishes authority
- Higher conversion to DMs

**Current strength**: This is your comfort zone

---

### Short-Form (300 words)
**When to use**:
- Quick observations
- Lifestyle posts (Pillar 4)
- Hot takes
- Pattern interrupts

**Why experiment**:
- Faster to create
- Higher volume potential
- Tests different audience segments
- Builds short-form muscle

**Current challenge**: Need to develop concision

**Practice approach**:
- Start with long draft
- Cut to essence
- "If I could only say this in 300 words..."

---

## Posting Schedule & Cadence

**Target**: 5 posts/week (Monday-Friday)

**Weekly rhythm**:
- **Monday**: Framework or tactical (Pillar 3) OR Founder journey (Pillar 1)
- **Tuesday**: MOMENTUM program update (Pillar 2) OR Founder story (Pillar 1)
- **Wednesday**: Tactical/framework (Pillar 3)
- **Thursday**: MOMENTUM launch/case study (Pillar 2) OR Lifestyle (Pillar 4)
- **Friday**: Lifestyle/embodiment (Pillar 4) OR Founder journey (Pillar 1)

**Flexibility**: Adjust based on cohort launch timing—increase Pillar 2 during launch weeks

**Best times to post** (test and track):
- Early morning (6-8am PT): Catches morning scroll
- Lunch (12-1pm PT): Midday break
- Evening (5-7pm PT): After-work wind-down

---

## Repurposing Strategy

**Not a priority yet** (focus on original LinkedIn content first), but future opportunities:

**From LinkedIn to**:
- Twitter threads (break down long posts)
- Email newsletter (best-performing posts)
- YouTube shorts (framework posts as quick videos)

**To LinkedIn from**:
- MOMENTUM workshop insights → framework posts
- 1:1 conversations → anonymized lessons
- Demo day wins → case study posts
- Personal breakthroughs → founder journey posts

---

## Hashtag Strategy

**Current approach**: Minimal hashtag use (Nik doesn't rely heavily on them)

**When to use**:
- Community challenges: #75VIBES
- Trending topics when relevant: #BuildInPublic
- MOMENTUM-specific: #MOMENTUMBuilder (when building brand)

**Max per post**: 2-3 (LinkedIn algorithm doesn't favor hashtag stuffing)

**Don't** force hashtags just to have them

---

## Algorithm Insights

**What LinkedIn rewards**:
- Time spent on post (long-form storytelling wins)
- Comments (especially multi-turn conversations)
- Shares (higher value than likes)
- Profile clicks from post
- Early engagement (first hour matters)

**What LinkedIn penalizes**:
- External links in post body
- Overly salesy language
- Hashtag stuffing
- Low engagement relative to follower count

**Optimize for**:
- Conversation-starting questions
- Shareable insights and frameworks
- Content that makes people tag friends
- DMs (best signal you're creating value)

---

## Engagement Strategy

**Reply to every meaningful comment** within first 2 hours:
- Ask follow-up questions
- Acknowledge their story
- Move conversation to DMs when appropriate

**Proactive engagement**:
- Comment on posts from target audience (founders, builders)
- Share insights, not just "great post"
- Build relationships with 10-20 key community members

**DM follow-up**:
- When someone comments with interest: "Thanks for engaging! Want to chat about your idea? DM me"
- When someone tags a friend: Send that friend a welcome DM
- Fast response time = higher conversion

---

## Continuous Improvement

**Monthly review**:
1. Pull metrics from all posts (use tracking spreadsheet)
2. Identify top 3 performers by:
   - Engagement rate
   - DMs generated
   - Applications driven
3. Analyze what made them work:
   - Hook style?
   - Story type?
   - Content pillar?
   - CTA approach?
4. Create more of what works
5. Kill or adapt what doesn't

**Quarterly review**:
- Are you hitting application goals?
- Is audience growing (quality > quantity)?
- Which pillar drives most conversion?
- Should we adjust content mix?

---

## Notes & Resources

**Inspiration sources**:
- Your past posts (learn from your wins)
- Builders you admire on LinkedIn
- Communities: Lovable shipped, builder groups
- Your lived experience (best source)

**Never**:
- Copy others' voices
- Chase trends that don't fit
- Sacrifice authenticity for engagement
- Post just to post (quality > quantity)

---

## Final Reminder

**The content that converts isn't the most polished—it's the most authentic.**

Nik's superpower is vulnerable storytelling + tactical systems. When you combine both (story + framework), that's when magic happens.

Lead with humanity. Back it with structure. Always offer the builder's journey, not just the destination.

Your best post is the one that makes a founder reading it at 2am think: "This person gets exactly what I'm going through. I need to join MOMENTUM."
