7 vibe-coding hacks everyone is sleeping on!

Non-technical vibe-coders, learn from my failing forward:

#1 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐢𝐧 𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐝𝐨𝐰𝐧

At some point, I had too much of the pixel-pushing, handoff issues, and context switching.

My solution? Skip Figma entirely!

I just take my sketch, ask Claude Code to turn it into a structured markdown file, and text-edit it right in my codebase.

Now, I can move buttons, adjust copy, or refine spacing at my speed of thought.

#2 𝐕𝐢𝐛𝐞-𝐜𝐨𝐝𝐞 𝐚𝐬 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐞

Context management is everything, and it starts with your own mental state.

This is why I anchored vibe-coding firmly in the first 2hrs of all my days.

At night, I define how I want the user to feel, and in the morning, I figure out how to build it.

While this might sound extreme, it's how I operate with pure, meditative focus and easily push any distraction away.

#3 𝐊𝐞𝐞𝐩 𝐚 𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥-𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐥𝐨𝐰.𝐦𝐝

Vibe-coding gets me into flow state! But while waiting for AI, my mind wanders, thinks ahead, and generates creative ideas.

While I don't want to lose them, I don't like the distraction.

So, I keep a running mental-overflow.md with my 𝘊𝘶𝘳𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘍𝘰𝘤𝘶𝘴,  𝘕𝘦𝘹𝘵 𝘚𝘵𝘦𝘱𝘴, and 𝘙𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘰𝘮 𝘐𝘥𝘦𝘢𝘴.

This way, I stay in my zone and can assess later whether they are shiny objects that give me feel-good dopamine, or actually move the needle for my business.

#4 𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐆𝐏𝐓'𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐭 𝐨𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐫

Turning my thoughts into well-structured, clear, and context-rich prompts is hard.

To ease my flow, I use ChatGPT's dedicated Prompt Optimizer (yes, there's a specific tool that's much better than the default chat).

I also start every session with a prompt that initializes the context relevant to what I'm working on and identifies any logical gaps before executing.

Using AI to write better AI instructions creates a compounding feedback loop that both gets me better results and accelerates my learning curve.

#5 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐭 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐆𝐢𝐭𝐇𝐮𝐛

Often I returned to my code and couldn't remember why I made certain choices, costing me hours or even days resolving a problem or rebuilding a feature...

Committing only finished features or fixed bugs wasn't working with my growing technical skills.

But adding statements at every decision point helps me trace back why something exists.

With my git log preserving my reasoning, I can not only see my lessons, but also vibe-code with more conviction.

#6 𝐃𝐞𝐛𝐮𝐠 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐨𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐚𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐬𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐭𝐬

Prompting lazily "fix the CTA button" has gotten me in a lot of trouble.

Now I share error codes, dig into logs, or annotated screenshots with what I want changed.

No more guessing what's broken or endless debugging loops.

Just surgical precision on what the problem is and how to solve it quickly.

#7 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐩𝐮𝐛𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐥𝐲 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲

Your excitement is the most authentic marketing you'll ever have!

Share your wins, your failures, and what you learn along the way.

Whether in WhatsApp, Twitter, or LinkedIn—people love watching someone build in real-time.

It attracts collaborators, early users, and valuable feedback that compound into real momentum.

Mastering vibe-coding isn't just about shipping faster. It's about building what's right—with more clarity, speed, and conviction.
