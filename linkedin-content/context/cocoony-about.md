# Cocoony - Project Description

Vibe-coding my way toward my impact goal of bringing 1 billion people together!

Currently paused while I make MOMENTUM amazing and vibe-code its tech foundation.

The project I'm most proud of: Cocoony, an AI shopping companion.

Called a "life saver for GenZ," Cocoony AI matches you to real people with your body type and fit challenges.

It's trained on 100,000+ Reddit comments, TikTok fit checks, and YouTube try-on hauls.

Create your fit profile once, and know what size will fit every time!

94% accuracy. Zero measurements. Zero body scans. Zero selfies.

Just the largest database of real-person fit data, working for you.

Get one-click size predictions, then chat about any fit, style, or sizing questions before you checkout with confidence.

Saving online shoppers 17 hours and $320 annually in sizing mistakes! ðŸ’œ
