Today marks a major shift: I'm entering DISTRIBUTION mode for my AI shopping companion. 🔥

It's time for a momentous push from now until I get to go home for Christmas! 🇩🇪🎄

Here are my commitments:
• 100 founding users by Oct 23
• 1,000 waitlisters by Nov 13
• 10,000 waitlisters by Dec 25

And, here is my distribution strategy:

#1 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐚 '𝐅𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐬' 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐨𝐧 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐬𝐀𝐩𝐩
• Co-create the product with design partners who believe in the vision
• Share previews, give early access, and ask for feedback

#2 𝐏𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫-𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐨𝐧 𝐛𝐨𝐭𝐡 𝐈𝐆 & 𝐓𝐢𝐤𝐓𝐨𝐤
• Document my founding journey through a hand-made 'build-along' series
• Occasionally "sell the pain" via carousels and creative stunts

#3 𝐏𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐀𝐈-𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐨𝐧 𝐛𝐨𝐭𝐡 𝐈𝐆 & 𝐓𝐢𝐤𝐓𝐨𝐤
• Build a clip library of UGC intros, pain and relief moments, and CTA outros
• Mix-and-match, post organically first, and refine test results via paid boosts
• Power it with AI workflows to experiment fast and well at scale

#4 𝐓𝐚𝐩 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐦 𝐚𝐮𝐝𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐬
• Ask 10 ideal influencers (2-50k followers) for feedback daily via a 3-part message
• Share the product only after their first reply and nurture them into ambassadors

#5 𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐜𝐤-𝐨𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐲 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦
• Invite highly-engaged community members and ambassadors
• Accept them only if the first two features convert at >1%

Every week, I'll share my progress and what's actually working in consumer growth right now.

No outdated playbook. No hollow principles. No overthinking.

Just real-time execution and sharing the good and the bad!

Follow along to see how this unfolds!
