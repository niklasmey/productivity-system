Cohort#4 of my sprints has just lifted off! And, I'm so fired up! 🚀🔥

10 bold founders, 6 weeks of relentless execution, and many powerful goals.

Together, we locked in on building toward personal freedom and permitted ourselves to play full on.

Here is what some of them are building:
Ewa Szyszka • A voice agent helping aspiring pilots learn how to talk to air traffic control
George Nnodim • A visual-first marketplace that matches clients with freelancers fast and intuitively
Tanya Coller • An app allowing everyone to reach their representatives with their key concerns in a few taps
Jackson Lester • A map that helps people find and use self-driving taxi services in their city
Niklas Mey (that's me) • An AI shopping companion that helps everyone order clothes that fit

We're done with the courses, planning, and talking.

Now, it's time to build with MOMENTUM!

With this cohort's energy and the proven structure of my 6-week Sprints, I'm eager to see what we accomplish by Nov 7.

I've already maxed out the 10 seats available for this cohort.

But I might be able to squeeze in one more person.

DM me to apply.
