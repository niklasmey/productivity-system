IDK why so many people are still learning backwards?

Look, I've been there, over-consuming podcasts, watching tutorials as entertainment, and even completing the occasional course.

Every time, I wished someday someone would see me..

Giving me permission to do the work I actually wanted to do!

But what if that someday someone never comes?

Now I know that picking a real project and starting to build it is the best way to learn!

Wanna get into 3D-printing? Buy one and make business cards.

Wanna master AI image prompting? Create a calendar just for you.

Wanna find the love of your life? Go out there and talk to strangers.

As long as you strive towards a slightly scary yet realistic goal, it could be anything.

Because when your mind is set, it biases the right information.

As you read, study, or have conversations, good dopamine signals what matters for your project.

While you rest, your subconscious keeps working on problems.

Solutions surface particularly when you aren't trying, like when preparing a meal, driving to town, or walking the dog.

As you compound progress towards your goal, learnings and insights stack without you even noticing.

So, stop being a learner and start being a builder.

Better yet? Build alongside others who get it.

Get the feedback loop that the someday someone never provided.

Make real breakthroughs from structured reflection and a supportive community.

Become not just any builder, but a MOMENTUM Builder! 🔥

My next cohort starts Nov 17. 10+ people build alongside each other. DM me to join the waitlist!
