## Campaign Strategy

### Phase 0: Story-Setting Week (Nov 3-5)
**Focus**: NO PITCHING - Pure value, lessons learned, normalizing support systems
**Approach**: Vulnerable stories, framework sharing, behind-the-scenes from past cohorts
**LinkedIn Performance**: Sun-Tue = moderate reach, focus on relationship-building content

### Phase 1: Announcement Week (Nov 6-10)

### **Sun, Nov 3 - MY 5-YEAR SECRET: I WORK WITH AN EMBODIMENT COACH**
**Post Type**: Lifestyle + Founder Journey (Pillar 4 + 1)
**Format**: Long-form (700-900 words)
**Target Score**: 78-83/100
**Expected Reach**: Lower (Sunday) - relationship-building content, not conversion

**Hook**:
"For 5 years, I've had a secret weapon most founders don't talk about: I work with an embodiment coach."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Normalize working with coaches/mentors
2. **Why I started** (2019):
   - Burning out building startups
   - Thought it was just for stress management
   - Discovered: My body knows when I'm building the wrong things
3. **What embodiment coaching actually is**:
   - Not therapy (though also valuable)
   - Not business coaching (different lane)
   - Somatic awareness: Your body signals truth before your brain rationalizes
4. **Real examples**:
   - Sick feeling before Cocoony fundraising = body saying "this is a prison"
   - Energy spike talking to builders = body saying "this is it"
   - Tension in chest when overcommitting = body's "no"
5. **My full support system** (normalize this):
   - **Embodiment coach**: Weekly sessions, helps me trust my gut
   - **Business mentor**: [Name if you want], helps with strategy
   - **Peer builders**: [Community names], for sanity checks
   - **Therapist**: [Optional to mention], for the deep stuff
6. **The insight**: The best founders don't do it alone. They build support systems.
7. **Vulnerable moment**: "I used to think asking for help was weakness. Now I know it's competitive advantage."
8. **NO MOMENTUM TIE-IN**: Just pure value, no pitch
9. **CTA**: "What support systems do you have? Comment below—genuinely curious."

**Why this works**:
- Normalizes getting help (sets up community value prop)
- Unique angle (not many talk about this)
- Sunday = lower reach, but builds relationship with engaged audience
- No pitch = builds trust before announcement

**Strategic purpose**: Pre-frame that having structure, accountability, and support is normal and smart

### **Mon, Nov 4 - WHAT I LEARNED FROM SETTING SPRINT GOALS WITH 40 BUILDERS**
**Post Type**: Framework (Pillar 3)
**Format**: Long-form (800-1000 words)
**Target Score**: 85-90/100
**Expected Reach**: Moderate (Monday) - tactical value post

**Hook**:
"I've set sprint goals with 40 builders over 4 cohorts. Here's what I learned about the difference between goals that work and goals that let you hide."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Reframed from data claim to personal learning
2. **The pattern I noticed**:
   - Week 1 of every cohort: Everyone shows up with vague goals
   - "Launch my MVP"
   - "Get traction"
   - "Validate my idea"
3. **Why these goals fail**: They're hiding mechanisms
   - Can't measure "traction"
   - "Launch" doesn't mean revenue
   - "Validate" is subjective
4. **What changed when we rewrote them**:
   - ❌ "Launch MVP" → ✅ "Get 5 people to pay $50 for pre-sale before I build anything"
   - ❌ "Validate idea" → ✅ "Talk to 20 potential customers, get 10 to say they'd pay"
   - ❌ "Get traction" → ✅ "$500 MRR by Dec 31"
5. **The framework that emerged**: SMART goals, but actually smart
   - **Specific**: What exactly? (not "customers" but "5 paying customers at $200/mo")
   - **Measurable**: Number, not feeling
   - **Ambitious**: 30% feels unrealistic (if comfortable, aim higher)
   - **Realistic**: 70% feels achievable (if impossible, break down)
   - **Time-bound**: Exact date (Dec 31, not "Q4")
6. **The real insight**: Winners set uncomfortable goals. People who hide set comfortable ones.
7. **Example transformation** (anonymized):
   - Builder came in: "I want to launch my SaaS"
   - We rewrote: "Get 3 companies to pay $100/mo before I write any code"
   - Result: Had 5 pre-sales in 3 weeks, built only what they paid for
8. **Vulnerable moment**: "I used to set goals like 'build a great product.' That's not a goal. That's a wish. Took me 6 years to learn this."
9. **The lesson**: Your goal should make you slightly uncomfortable to say out loud. If it doesn't, it's not ambitious enough.
10. **NO MOMENTUM TIE-IN**: Pure framework sharing, no pitch
11. **CTA**: "What's a goal you've been setting that might be letting you hide? (Asking because I've been there.)"

**Why this works**:
- Natural hook (lessons learned, not salesy)
- Immediately actionable framework
- Vulnerable (you're learning too)
- Before/after examples = relatability
- Monday = solid reach for tactical content
- Sets up value of goal-setting process (which is what happens in cohort)

**Strategic purpose**: Demonstrate your framework works + show how you help builders (without pitching yet)

### **Tue, Nov 5 - EVERY COACH WHO DOESN'T RECEIVE COACHING IS A FRAUD**
**Post Type**: Founder Journey + Hot Take (Pillar 1)
**Format**: Medium-form (600-800 words)
**Target Score**: 83-88/100
**Expected Reach**: Moderate-High (Tuesday) - contrarian, engaging

**Hook**:
"Every coach who doesn't receive coaching themselves is a fraud. There, I said it."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Bold, contrarian statement
2. **Why I believe this**:
   - I run an accelerator coaching builders
   - I have 3 coaches/mentors working with me
   - If I'm not getting coached, how can I coach authentically?
3. **My current coaching setup**:
   - **Embodiment coach** (weekly): Keeps me grounded, helps me trust gut decisions
   - **Business mentor** [name if comfortable]: Strategy, blind spots, sanity checks
   - **Peer accountability** (builder friends): Raw feedback, reality checks
4. **What each one gives me**:
   - Embodiment coach: "That sick feeling before fundraising? Your body's telling you no."
   - Business mentor: "You're overthinking this. Just ask 10 people."
   - Peer builders: "That's not how it works in reality. Here's what actually happens."
5. **Why coaches need coaches**:
   - You can't see your own blind spots
   - You need someone to catch you when you're spiraling
   - You need permission to struggle (even coaches struggle)
   - You need someone who's ahead of where you are
6. **The fraud part**:
   - If you're coaching but not being coached: You're stagnant
   - If you're teaching but not learning: You're outdated
   - If you're holding people accountable but have no accountability: You're a hypocrite
7. **Vulnerable moment**:
   - "I tried coaching without coaches once. Burned out in 3 months."
   - "I thought I could 'give' without 'receiving'. Emptied my tank."
   - "Now I know: You can't pour from an empty cup. Get coached."
8. **The lesson**: The best coaches are永students. The best teachers have teachers.
9. **Apply to any field**:
   - Best athletes have coaches
   - Best therapists have therapists
   - Best writers have editors
   - Best builders have mentors
10. **NO MOMENTUM TIE-IN**: Pure hot take + transparency
11. **CTA**: "Do you have coaches/mentors? Who's holding you accountable? (Genuinely curious.)"

**Why this works**:
- Contrarian statement = comments + debate
- Tuesday = good reach for hot takes
- Normalizes getting help (sets up MOMENTUM value prop)
- Shows you practice what you preach
- Vulnerable (admitting you need help)
- Positions you as self-aware, not guru

**Strategic purpose**: Reinforce that having coaches/structure/accountability is normal and necessary (which is exactly what MOMENTUM provides)

## PHASE 1: ANNOUNCEMENT WEEK (Nov 6-10)

---

### **Wed, Nov 6 - OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT** 🔥
**Post Type**: MOMENTUM Program (Pillar 2)
**Format**: Long-form (700-900 words)
**Target Score**: 80-85/100

**Hook**:
"🔥 Cohort #4 officially opens TODAY. 12-16 spots. Nov 17-Dec 17. Here's what 40 builders before you learned."

**Structure**:
1. **Bold announcement**: Cohort #4 is open
2. **The why**: After 4 cohorts, this system works (38/40 say SMART goals = biggest needle-mover)
3. **What you get**:
   - 5-week sprint (Mondays workshops, Wednesdays coworking, Fridays 1:1s, daily WhatsApp)
   - Rule of Two validation framework

**Expected engagement**: High reach (announcement posts get 5x boost from profile update)

---

### **Thu, Nov 7 - RAW FEAR: WHAT IF THE SEATS DON'T FILL?**
**Post Type**: Founder Journey (Pillar 1) - RAW VULNERABILITY
**Format**: Medium-form (500-700 words)
**Target Score**: 85-90/100 ⭐ HIGH POTENTIAL
**Expected Reach**: Very High (Thursday) - peak day + raw vulnerability = viral potential

**Hook**:
"Posted the announcement yesterday. Now I'm sitting here scared shitless that almost none of the 12 seats fill up."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Raw, honest fear
2. **The context** (Rücken zur Wand):
   - Runway ends at year-end
   - This needs to work
   - Not a side project anymore—it's the bet
3. **What I'm scared of**:
   - What if only 3 people sign up? (has happened before)
   - What if all the content, effort, energy doesn't convert?
   - What if I'm building something nobody wants?
   - What if I have to go back to [previous path]?
4. **The doubt**:
   - "Maybe I should've kept building tech products"
   - "Maybe I'm not cut out for this"
   - "Maybe helping builders isn't a real business"
   - "Maybe I'm fooling myself"
5. **Why I'm sharing this**:
   - Not for sympathy
   - Because every founder feels this
   - The night before a launch, you question everything
   - And yet... you hit publish anyway
6. **The bet I'm making**:
   - That 40+ builders finding value wasn't a fluke
   - That the 38/40 who say goal-setting changed everything weren't lying
   - That the testimonials are real, not cherry-picked
   - That this matters to people beyond my bubble
7. **Vulnerable moment**:
   - "I have 9 days to find out if this bet pays off."
   - "Runway ends December. This cohort needs to fill."
   - "I'm scared. And I'm betting anyway."
8. **The realization**:
   - This fear = proof I care
   - If I wasn't scared, it wouldn't matter
   - Every builder I've coached has felt this exact feeling
   - That's why MOMENTUM exists—to feel this fear together, not alone
9. **MOMENTUM tie-in** (natural):
   - "If you're feeling this too—that your idea might not work, that you might fail publicly—I get it. Nov 17, let's be scared together. DM me 'COHORT'."
10. **CTA**: "Who else is building something that scares them? You're not alone."

**Why this works**:
- RAW vulnerability = highly shareable
- Thursday = peak reach day
- "Rücken zur Wand" (back against wall) = stakes are REAL
- Every founder relates to launch fear
- Shows you're human, not guru
- Makes MOMENTUM feel more urgent (he needs this too)
- Creates "betting on himself" narrative that's inspiring

**Strategic purpose**:
- Show REAL stakes (not fake scarcity)
- Make cohort launch feel urgent and authentic
- Bond with founders who feel same fear
- Position MOMENTUM as doing it together vs alone

### **Fri, Nov 8 - I'VE HOSTED 10 COWORKING SESSIONS FOR BUILDERS**
**Post Type**: Behind-the-Scenes (Pillar 2)
**Format**: Short-medium (400-600 words)
**Target Score**: 78-83/100
**Expected Reach**: High (Friday) - behind-scenes + value demonstration

**Hook**:
"I've hosted 10 coworking sessions for builders over 4 cohorts. Here's what I've learned about why they work."

**Structure**:
1. **The setup**: What coworking sessions are
   - Wednesday afternoons, 2 hours
   - Everyone working on their thing, together
   - Not presentations—just parallel work + support
2. **Why they work** (insights from 10 sessions):
   - Body doubling: Having others working = you work harder
   - Immediate help: Stuck? Ask the room, get unstuck in 5 min
   - Accountability: Said you'd do something? Now do it with witnesses
   - Energy: Solo building is draining. Group energy is contagious.
3. **What actually happens**:
   - Someone ships landing page live in the session
   - Someone does customer interview with group listening
   - Someone asks "does this messaging make sense?" and gets instant feedback
   - Someone just needs the push to START
4. **Why not just async**:
   - Async = easy to hide
   - Live = nowhere to hide, in the best way
   - The magic is the real-time energy
5. **Vulnerable moment**: "I started these because I hated building alone. Turns out, so does everyone else."
6. **MOMENTUM tie-in**: "We do this every Wednesday. Nov 17-Dec 17."
7. **CTA**: "Want in? DM me 'COHORT'."

**Why this works**:
- Friday = high reach, value demonstration
- Shows structure (not just "community access")
- Real examples of what happens
- Addresses isolation pain point
- Natural MOMENTUM tie-in

### **Sat, Nov 9 - INTRODUCING: SHADOWING USER INTERVIEWS**
**Post Type**: Feature Announcement (Pillar 2)
**Format**: Medium-form (500-700 words)
**Target Score**: 80-85/100
**Expected Reach**: Moderate (Saturday) - unique feature reveal

**Hook**:
"New for Cohort #4: I'm going to shadow your live customer interviews. Here's why this matters."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Feature reveal
2. **What it is**:
   - I join your user interview as silent observer
   - You conduct the interview, I watch + take notes
   - After: We debrief what worked, what to ask differently
3. **Why this matters**:
   - Most builders have never done customer interviews
   - You think you're asking good questions, but you're leading them
   - You miss signals because you're nervous and trying to take notes
   - One bad interview technique = months building wrong thing
4. **What I'm listening for** (that you might miss):
   - When they dodge a question (= polite rejection)
   - When they get angry (= real pain)
   - When they say "interesting" vs "where do I pay?" (huge difference)
   - When they solve the problem with duct tape (= validates need)
5. **How it works**:
   - You schedule interview with potential customer
   - I join on Zoom, camera off, muted
   - You run the interview
   - After they leave: 15-min debrief
   - I share what I heard that you didn't
6. **Why I'm doing this**:
   - Customer interviews = make-or-break for 0→1
   - Reading a framework ≠ doing it well
   - Shadowing = you learn by doing (with safety net)
   - This helps me give better 1:1 guidance (I understand your customer)
7. **Real example** (past cohorts, no shadowing yet):
   - Builder: "I talked to 10 people, all said it's a good idea"
   - Me: "What exact words did they use?"
   - Builder: "They said 'interesting' and 'I'd maybe use it'"
   - Me: "That's polite rejection, not validation"
   - Result: Killed idea Week 2, saved months
8. **What changes with shadowing**:
   - I catch these signals LIVE
   - You learn what questions actually work
   - We adjust interview approach in real-time (after each call)
   - You get better at interviewing faster
9. **Vulnerable moment**: "I wasted 6 months building something because I heard what I wanted to hear in interviews, not what they actually said."
10. **MOMENTUM tie-in**: Natural (new Cohort #4 feature)
11. **CTA**: "Want me to shadow your customer interviews? Nov 17-Dec 17. DM me 'COHORT'."

**Why this works**:
- Saturday = moderate reach, feature content
- Unique (not many coaches do this)
- Addresses critical skill gap (interviewing)
- Shows depth of support (I'm in it with you)
- Demonstrates why results happen (better guidance)

### **Sun, Nov 10 - INTRODUCING: MONDAY WORKSHOPS**
**Post Type**: Feature Announcement (Pillar 2)
**Format**: Medium-form (500-700 words)
**Target Score**: 79-84/100
**Expected Reach**: Lower (Sunday) - but valuable for engaged audience

**Hook**:
"Every Monday in MOMENTUM, we run a workshop. Here's what we're covering Nov 17 - Dec 15."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Direct feature reveal
2. **Why workshops**:
   - You need frameworks, not just "figure it out"
   - You need to see the process, not just hear about it
   - You need to apply it immediately (not watch and forget)
3. **The 5 Monday workshops** (Nov 17 - Dec 15):
   - **Week 1 (Nov 17)**: Setting SMART goals that are slightly scary
     - How to turn "launch MVP" into "get 5 pre-sales by Dec 15"
     - Public goal-setting (say it to the group = accountability)

   - **Week 2 (Nov 24)**: Customer interview masterclass
     - How to talk to 20 people without being salesy
     - The questions that reveal real pain

   - **Week 3 (Dec 1)**: Rule of Two validation framework
     - 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months timeline
     - Kill or continue decision tree

   - **Week 4 (Dec 8)**: Messaging that converts
     - One-sentence pitch that makes people ask "how does it work?"
     - Landing page teardowns (we'll review yours live)

   - **Week 5 (Dec 15)**: Demo day prep
     - How to present what you built (even if it's messy)
     - Practice runs with feedback
4. **How workshops work**:
   - 90 minutes, Zoom, Mondays 5-6:30pm PT
   - I teach for 30 min, you apply for 60 min
   - Breakout rooms for peer feedback
   - You leave with homework (do it by Wednesday coworking)
5. **Why this is different from courses**:
   - ❌ Courses: Watch passively, forget everything
   - ✅ Workshops: Do the work IN the session, get feedback
   - You literally set your goal in Week 1 workshop (not after you "finish the module")
6. **What past builders said**:
   - "Week 2 workshop changed how I do customer interviews"
   - "Messaging workshop helped me finally explain what I'm building"
   - "I dreaded demo day until the prep workshop"
7. **Recordings available**: Can't make it live? Recording + slides in Notion after
8. **MOMENTUM tie-in**: Natural (entire post)
9. **CTA**: "Cohort #4 starts Monday, Nov 17. First workshop = goal-setting. DM me 'COHORT' to join."

**Why this works**:
- Sunday = lower reach, but shows structure
- Specific (lists exact workshops)
- Shows structure (not just "community access")
- Differentiate from courses
- Natural urgency (starts Nov 17)

### **Mon, Nov 11 - INTRAPRENEURS: 5-STEP PLAYBOOK TO SHIP INTERNAL PROJECTS FAST**
**Post Type**: Framework (Pillar 3)
**Format**: Long-form (900-1200 words)
**Target Score**: 83-88/100
**Expected Reach**: Moderate (Monday) - ICP-specific tactical

**Hook**:
"After coaching intrapreneurs at startups and scale-ups, here's the 5-step playbook to ship 0-1 projects without getting stuck in corporate BS."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Intrapreneur-specific
2. **Context**: The unique challenge
   - You have resources (team, budget, brand)
   - You have bureaucracy (approvals, stakeholders, politics)
   - You need to ship fast or project gets killed
   - You're being measured on outcomes, not activity
3. **Step 1: Pick ONE problem your team/company is actually feeling (not strategic deck problems)**
   - ❌ Don't: "We should explore AI" (too vague)
   - ✅ Do: "Sales team wastes 10 hrs/week on manual data entry" (specific pain)
   - Why: Real pain = internal champions, vague "opportunities" = committee death
4. **Step 2: Get 5 internal users to say "if you build this, I'll use it daily" (1 week)**
   - Talk to the people who feel the pain (not their managers)
   - Ask: "How much time does this waste?" and "What have you tried?"
   - Goal: Find 5 who are desperate enough to be your beta testers
   - Why: Internal buy-in before you ask for budget = way easier approval
5. **Step 3: Build scrappy MVP in 2 weeks (not 2 months)**
   - ❌ Don't: "Let's do discovery for 6 weeks then build perfect v1"
   - ✅ Do: Airtable + Zapier + ugly UI that barely works
   - Why: Speed > polish for 0-1, you'll learn more in 2 weeks of users than 6 weeks of planning
6. **Step 4: Get those 5 people using it daily (no formal launch, just: "try this")**
   - Don't ask permission, just share link
   - Daily check-ins: "What's broken? What's missing?"
   - Goal: Prove daily usage before you scale
   - Why: Usage data = undeniable proof it works
7. **Step 5: Scale or kill based on USAGE, not feedback (after 2 weeks)**
   - **If 4/5 use it daily without you nagging**: Pitch for resources to scale
   - **If 1/5 use it**: Kill it, try next idea
   - Don't confuse "this is cool" with "I use this daily"
8. **Real example** (anonymized):
   - Intrapreneur at tech company, tasked with "innovation"
   - Saw customer success team doing manual work
   - Built Airtable automation in 1 weekend
   - Got 5 CS reps using it daily in Week 1
   - Leadership saw usage data, gave budget for proper build
   - Shipped internal tool used by 50+ people in 2 months
9. **The pattern across intrapreneurs**:
   - Those who asked for permission first: Stuck in committee for months
   - Those who built scrappy first: Got retroactive approval
   - Those who picked vague problems: Project got killed
   - Those who picked felt pain: Found internal champions
10. **Vulnerable moment**: "I've seen intrapreneurs spend 6 months on 'strategy decks' instead of shipping. Ship first, deck later."
11. **Why intrapreneurs struggle**:
   - Corporate expects "process" (discovery → design → build → test)
   - 0-1 requires "chaos" (build → test → learn → iterate fast)
   - You have to break rules quietly to ship fast
12. **MOMENTUM tie-in** (soft): "This is the same 5-week 0-1 process. Nov 17-Dec 17."
13. **CTA**: "Intrapreneurs: What internal problem are you avoiding? DM me 'COHORT' to join Nov 17."

**Why this works**:
- Monday = moderate reach, tactical
- ICP-specific (intrapreneurs = 10% but underserved)
- Permission to break corporate rules
- Fast timeline (2 weeks MVP)
- Real example from corporate world

### **Tue, Nov 12 - DOUBLE POST DAY** 🔥

#### **POST 1 (Morning) - INTRODUCING: MOMENTUM BUILDER PLATFORM**
**Post Type**: Feature Announcement (Pillar 2)
**Format**: Medium-form (500-700 words)
**Target Score**: 80-85/100
**Expected Reach**: Very High (Tuesday) - peak day + new feature

**Hook**:
"I built a platform for MOMENTUM builders. Here's what you get access to on Day 1."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: New feature reveal
2. **What it is**:
   - Notion workspace (clean, organized, not overwhelming)
   - Everything you need in one place
   - Updated weekly with new resources
3. **What's inside**:
   - **Sprint Board**: Your OKRs, week-by-week progress tracking
   - **Workshop Library**: All 5 workshops (recordings + slides + templates)
   - **Framework Database**: Rule of Two, SMART goals, customer interview scripts, messaging templates
   - **Resource Library**: Tools, no-code platforms, AI coding guides
   - **Builder Directory**: See what everyone's building, who to ask for help
   - **Check-in Log**: Weekly 1:1 notes, action items, accountability
4. **Why I built this**:
   - Cohort #1: Everything was scattered (Google Docs, Miro, chaos)
   - Cohort #2: Tried Notion, but too complex
   - Cohort #3: Simplified, kept only what builders actually used
   - Cohort #4: Finally clean, simple, useful
5. **What you WON'T find** (kept it lean):
   - ❌ No endless video courses (workshops are live, not pre-recorded lectures)
   - ❌ No complex project management (just simple OKR tracking)
   - ❌ No busy work (only tools you'll actually use)
6. **How builders use it**:
   - Day 1: Set OKRs in Sprint Board
   - Mondays: Check workshop notes before session
   - Wednesdays: Log progress during coworking
   - Fridays: Review 1:1 action items
   - Anytime: Grab template (customer interview script, messaging framework)
7. **Access**: You get lifetime access (even after sprint ends)
8. **Vulnerable moment**: "I over-built this for Cohort #1. 50 pages nobody used. Now: 10 pages everyone uses."
9. **MOMENTUM tie-in**: Natural (entire post)
10. **CTA**: "Want access? Nov 17 we go live. DM me 'COHORT'."

**Why this works**:
- Tuesday = peak reach
- Shows you've thought through UX
- Differentiate from "Slack group + Zoom calls"
- Lifetime access = value add
- Transparency (shows what you WON'T include)

**Timing**: Post morning (8-10am PT)

---

#### **POST 2 (Evening, 4+ hours later) - I'VE DONE 250+ 1:1 CHECK-INS WITH BUILDERS**
**Post Type**: Behind-the-Scenes (Pillar 2)
**Format**: Medium-form (600-800 words)
**Target Score**: 80-85/100
**Expected Reach**: High (Tuesday evening) - depth of coaching

**Hook**:
"I've done 250+ one-on-one check-ins with builders over 4 cohorts. Here's what almost everyone gets wrong."

**Structure**:
1. **The setup**: What 1:1s are
   - Friday afternoon, 15-30 min each
   - Every builder, every week
   - Not just "how's it going?"—specific progress checks
2. **The pattern I see** (across 250+ check-ins):
   - Week 1: Everyone's optimistic ("I've got this!")
   - Week 2: Reality check ("This is harder than I thought")
   - Week 3: Crisis point ("Maybe I should quit")
   - Week 4: Breakthrough ("Oh, I see it now")
   - Week 5: Relief ("I actually did it")
3. **What almost everyone gets wrong**:
   - They think Week 3 crisis = failure
   - Actually: Week 3 crisis = you're doing it right
   - The messy middle is SUPPOSED to feel messy
   - That's when you need support most
4. **What I do in these check-ins**:
   - Week 1-2: Help them scope down (they always start too big)
   - Week 3: Catch them when they want to quit (this is critical)
   - Week 4-5: Help them ship something, anything
5. **Real examples** (anonymized):
   - Builder Week 3: "I haven't made progress. Should I drop out?"
   - Me: "You talked to 15 customers this week. That IS progress."
   - They stayed. They shipped.

   - Builder Week 5: "It's not perfect, I can't demo this."
   - Me: "Demo day isn't about perfect. It's about done."
   - They demoed. It was amazing.
6. **Vulnerable moment**: "I've been the person in Week 3 who wanted to quit. That's why I know how to catch you."
7. **Why 1:1s matter**:
   - Group calls = you can hide
   - 1:1s = nowhere to hide, I see you
   - That's the accountability that actually works
8. **MOMENTUM tie-in**: "Every builder gets weekly 1:1s. Nov 17-Dec 17."
9. **CTA**: "Want this level of support? DM me 'COHORT'."

**Why this works**:
- Tuesday = peak reach
- Shows depth of coaching (250+ sessions = proof)
- Addresses Week 3 crisis (relatable)
- Demonstrates why personal support matters
- Double-post strategy (test early in campaign)

**Timing**: Post evening (5-7pm PT), 4+ hours after first post

### **Wed, Nov 13 - FOUNDERS: 5-STEP PLAYBOOK TO GO FROM IDEA TO FIRST CUSTOMER**
**Post Type**: Framework (Pillar 3)
**Format**: Long-form (900-1200 words)
**Target Score**: 86-91/100 ⭐ HIGH POTENTIAL
**Expected Reach**: Very High (Wednesday) - tactical + ICP-specific

**Hook**:
"After coaching 30+ founders from idea to first paying customer, here's the 5-step playbook I'd use if I were starting from zero today."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Founder-specific playbook
2. **Context**: Why this playbook
   - Not theory—this is from 30+ founders going 0→1
   - Some got customers in 2 weeks, some in 5 weeks
   - All followed these 5 steps (in order)
3. **Step 1: Pick ONE painful problem you've personally experienced**
   - ❌ Don't: "I'll build X because it's a big market"
   - ✅ Do: "I struggled with X for 2 years, I know this pain intimately"
   - Why: You can't fake domain expertise in customer interviews
   - Example: Founder who built scheduling tool because they wasted 10 hrs/week on back-and-forth emails
4. **Step 2: Talk to 20 people who have this problem (Rule of Two: 2 days)**
   - Find them: LinkedIn, Twitter, communities, cold outreach
   - Ask: "Tell me about the last time you experienced [problem]"
   - Listen for: Pain intensity (do they get angry describing it?)
   - Goal: Find 10/20 who say "if you solve this, I'm in"
5. **Step 3: Describe your solution in ONE sentence (2 hours max)**
   - ❌ Don't: "It's like Uber for X meets AI-powered Y"
   - ✅ Do: "I help [specific person] solve [specific problem] in [specific way]"
   - Test it: If people ask "how does it work?", your sentence worked
   - Example: "I help freelancers get paid 30 days faster through automated invoice follow-ups"
6. **Step 4: Pre-sell before you build ANYTHING (2 weeks)**
   - Go back to the 10 who said "I'm in"
   - Say: "I'm building this. $X for early access. Pay now, I'll build it."
   - Goal: Get 3-5 to actually pay (not "interested", PAID)
   - Why: Payment = real validation, interest = polite rejection
7. **Step 5: Build ONLY what they paid for (2 months max)**
   - ❌ Don't: "Let me add these 10 features I thought of"
   - ✅ Do: Interview the 3-5 who paid, build minimal version that solves their exact pain
   - Ship in 2 months max (scrappy > polished)
   - Then: Get next 10 customers before adding ANY new features
8. **The pattern across 30+ founders**:
   - Those who skipped straight to building: 90% failed
   - Those who pre-sold first: 80% got to $1k+ MRR
   - Those who talked to <10 people: Built wrong thing
   - Those who talked to 20+: Found real pain to solve
9. **Vulnerable moment**: "I wasted 18 months building a product nobody wanted because I skipped steps 2-4. Don't be me."
10. **Why founders struggle with this**:
   - Step 2 is terrifying (talking to strangers)
   - Step 4 is uncomfortable (asking for money before it exists)
   - But: This is the only way to avoid building for 6 months and launching to crickets
11. **MOMENTUM tie-in** (soft): "This is exactly what we do in the 5-week sprint. Nov 17-Dec 17."
12. **CTA**: "Founders: Which step are you stuck on? (I can help.) DM me 'COHORT' to join Nov 17."

**Why this works**:
- Wednesday = peak reach, tactical content performs
- ICP-specific (founders = 60% of audience)
- Actionable immediately (can start today)
- Numbered framework (scannable, shareable)
- Addresses #1 founder mistake (building too early)
- Natural MOMENTUM tie-in (this is what we teach)
- Follows pattern of past 88/100 post (Getting Hired Playbook)

---

### **Thu, Nov 14 - INTRODUCING: PARTICIPATION PERKS & MOST PROGRESS AWARD**
**Post Type**: Feature Announcement (Pillar 2)
**Format**: Short-medium (400-600 words)
**Target Score**: 77-82/100
**Expected Reach**: High (Thursday) - fun, engaging

**Hook**:
"Added something new for Cohort #4: Participation Perks. Here's how it works."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Surprise feature
2. **The setup**: Why this exists
   - Some builders show up to everything, ship fast, help others
   - Some builders do the minimum, still get value but don't contribute
   - Wanted to reward the ones who go all-in
3. **Participation Perks** (how you earn them):
   - Attend 4/5 workshops = Perk unlocked
   - Attend 4/5 coworking sessions = Perk unlocked
   - Ship by demo day (even if messy) = Perk unlocked
   - Help 3+ other builders in WhatsApp = Perk unlocked
4. **What you get** (if you earn all perks):
   - Free access to next cohort (if you want to build something new)
   - OR 50% off for a friend (bring someone into next cohort)
   - Early access to new MOMENTUM features (workshops, tools, etc.)
5. **Most Progress Award** (new for Cohort #4):
   - One builder who made the MOST progress (not perfect, PROGRESS)
   - Measured by: Where you started vs where you ended
   - Winner gets: [Prize TBD - could be free coaching, spotlight, etc.]
   - Voted by peers (your fellow builders decide)
6. **Why this works**:
   - Rewards showing up (not just outcomes)
   - Gamifies participation (makes it fun)
   - Creates peer recognition (not just my approval)
7. **Not required**: You can still get value without perks, this just rewards going all-in
8. **Vulnerable moment**: "Cohort #3, one builder attended everything, helped everyone, shipped. They deserved recognition. This is that."
9. **MOMENTUM tie-in**: Natural
10. **CTA**: "Want to earn perks? Join Cohort #4, Nov 17. DM me 'COHORT'."

**Why this works**:
- Thursday = high reach
- Fun, unexpected (not typical "feature")
- Gamification = engagement
- Rewards behavior you want (participation)
- Shows you care about community dynamics

---

### **Fri, Nov 15 - [RAW POST - USER WILL WRITE]**
**Post Type**: Founder Journey / MOMENTUM Program (Pillar 1/2)
**Format**: Short-medium (400-600 words)
**Target Score**: 78-84/100
**Expected Reach**: High (Friday) - authentic excitement

**Hook**:
[User will write based on feelings at the time - about excitement for kick-off]

**Guidance for Nov 15**:
- Write RAW based on how you feel
- Theme: Excitement about starting Cohort #4 on Monday
- Possible angles:
  - How you're feeling 2 days before kick-off
  - What you're excited about / nervous about
  - Who has signed up (anonymized patterns)
  - The energy building toward Monday
- Keep it authentic, not scripted
- Natural MOMENTUM tie-in (entire post about cohort starting)
- CTA: "Last spots. Nov 17 we start. DM me 'COHORT' if you're on the fence."

**Why this approach works**:
- Friday = high reach, raw content performs
- Authentic > polished (you'll feel the energy, let it show)
- 2 days before start = natural urgency
- Real emotions = relatable

---

### **Sat, Nov 16 - SUNDAY SCARIES: [X HOURS] UNTIL KICK-OFF**
**Post Type**: MOMENTUM Program (Pillar 2)
**Format**: Short-form (300-400 words)
**Target Score**: 80-85/100
**Expected Reach**: Lower (Saturday) - but highly engaging for those on fence

**Hook**:
"Sunday Scaries hitting different today. In [X hours], Cohort #4 kicks off. Last call."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Plays on Sunday Scaries viral theme + actual time remaining
2. **The Sunday Scaries feeling**:
   - You know what you need to do tomorrow (start the week)
   - You're dreading it because you've been avoiding something
   - That idea you've had for months? Still sitting there.
   - Tomorrow it'll be "next week," then "next month," then "next year"
3. **What happens in [X hours]**:
   - 12-16 builders kick off Cohort #4
   - They'll set goals that scare them slightly
   - They'll commit publicly to shipping something by Dec 17
   - They'll stop saying "someday"
4. **Two paths**:
   - **Path A**: Join them. Feel Sunday Scaries but do it anyway.
   - **Path B**: Sit this one out. Next cohort is Feb 2025 (3 months away).
5. **The truth**: Sunday Scaries never go away. You just decide if you're going to act despite them.
6. **Last spots**: [X spots] left. [X hours] until kick-off.
7. **MOMENTUM tie-in**: Natural
8. **CTA**: "If you're feeling it—DM me 'COHORT' right now. Don't let Sunday Scaries win."

**Why this works**:
- Saturday = perfect for Sunday Scaries theme
- Time urgency (actual hours remaining)
- Emotional (taps into that Sunday feeling)
- Binary choice (join or wait 3 months)
- Last-minute FOMO for procrastinators

---

### **Sun, Nov 17 - WE'RE STARTING TODAY**
**Post Type**: MOMENTUM Program (Pillar 2)
**Format**: Short-form (300-500 words)
**Target Score**: 75-80/100
**Expected Reach**: Lower (Sunday) - but high engagement from committed audience

**Hook**:
"We're starting. Right now. Cohort #4 is officially underway. [Screenshot from kick-off call]"

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Present tense + visual proof (screenshot of Zoom/meet with faces blurred)
2. **What just happened**:
   - 12-16 builders just met for the first time
   - Workshop #1: Setting SMART goals that are slightly scary
   - Intros, energy, nervous excitement
   - WhatsApp group went live—already buzzing
3. **Who's in the room** (general, respect privacy):
   - Founders from [cities/countries if comfortable]
   - Career changers testing ideas while employed
   - Intrapreneurs shipping internal projects
   - All stuck between idea and traction—not anymore
4. **What happens next**:
   - Monday: Goal refinement check-in
   - Wednesday: First coworking session
   - Friday: 1:1s begin
   - Dec 17: Demo day (everyone shows what they built)
5. **The vibe right now**: Nervous energy, commitment, "we're really doing this"
6. **For everyone watching**:
   - I'll document the journey (wins, struggles, breakthroughs)
   - Follow along, see what happens when builders commit
   - Next cohort: Feb 2025
7. **MOMENTUM tie-in**: Natural (entire post)
8. **CTA**: "Cohort #4 is full. Want early access to Feb 2025? DM me 'WAITLIST'."

**Why this works**:
- Screenshot = proof it's real, happening now
- Sunday = lower reach but high engagement from invested audience
- FOMO for those who didn't join
- Transitions from selling to documenting
- Builds waitlist for next cohort

**Note**: Get screenshot during actual kick-off call (faces blurred for privacy)

## PHASE 3: POST-LAUNCH (Nov 18-20)

---

### **Mon, Nov 18 - THE REALITY CHECK: WHAT IT ACTUALLY TAKES**
**Post Type**: Behind-the-Scenes (Pillar 2)
**Format**: Long-form (700-900 words)
**Target Score**: 82-88/100
**Expected Reach**: High (Monday) - transparency + tactical

**Hook**:
"Everyone sees the '40+ builders, 4 cohorts' headline. Here's what it actually took to get here."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Pull back the curtain
2. **The metrics you see**:
   - 40+ builders served
   - 4 cohorts run
   - Looks successful, scaled, easy
3. **The reality you don't see**:
   - **Time investment**:
     - 15 hours/week during cohort (workshops, 1:1s, coworking)
     - 10 hours/week content creation (LinkedIn posts, frameworks)
     - 5 hours/week responding to DMs, community building
     - = 30 hours/week on top of everything else
   - **Emotional investment**:
     - Carrying 12-16 people's dreams every 5 weeks
     - Responding to 2am "I want to quit" messages
     - Celebrating wins, catching people when they stumble
   - **Financial reality**:
     - First cohort: 3 people (friends), $1,500 total
     - Second cohort: 8 people, $4,000 total
     - Third cohort: 12 people, $6,000 total
     - Fourth cohort: [X people], $[X] total
     - Not getting rich (yet). Doing it because it matters.
4. **What makes it worth it**:
   - Builder who landed first customer in Week 3
   - Career changer who quit their job with confidence
   - Intrapreneur who shipped internal project in 5 weeks
   - The 2am DM that says: "This changed my life"
5. **Vulnerable moment**:
   - "I'm not making startup money doing this. I'm making meaning. Some days that feels crazy. Most days it feels right."
6. **Why I'm sharing this**:
   - If you're building something that matters: it's supposed to be hard
   - If you're not seeing overnight success: you're on the right path
   - Sustainable businesses are built with time + care, not hacks
7. **The lesson**: Real effort vs results comparison
   - **Effort**: 30 hrs/week × 6 months = 720 hours
   - **Results**: 40 builders, $15k+ revenue, sustainable system
   - **Worth it?**: Absolutely. But it's not magic. It's work.
8. **NO MOMENTUM TIE-IN**: This is about transparency, not selling
9. **CTA**: "To every builder putting in the work: Keep going. It compounds."

**Why this works**:
- Monday = high reach for tactical content
- Transparency builds trust (not all wins, showing reality)
- Relatable (everyone's grinding)
- Post-launch timing (no longer selling, can be fully honest)
- Inspires others building sustainable businesses

### **Tue, Nov 19 - MY FULL TECH STACK (AND WHAT I PAY)**
**Post Type**: Framework + Tactical (Pillar 3)
**Format**: Long-form (800-1000 words)
**Target Score**: 80-86/100
**Expected Reach**: High (Tuesday) - tactical, shareable

**Hook**:
"People ask: 'What tools do you use to run MOMENTUM?' Here's my full tech stack and what I pay for it."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Direct answer to common question
2. **The full stack** (update with your actual tools):

   **Core operations**:
   - **Stripe** ($0 + fees) - Payments
   - **WhatsApp** ($0) - Community / daily support
   - **Zoom** ($15/mo) - Workshops, 1:1s, coworking
   - **Google Calendar** ($0) - Scheduling
   - **Notion** ($0) - Sprint tracking, OKRs, resources

   **Content & marketing**:
   - **LinkedIn** ($0) - All distribution (no ads)
   - **Claude Code** ($20/mo) - Content creation, drafting posts
   - **Figma** ($0 free plan) - Simple graphics when needed

   **Productivity**:
   - **Obsidian / Notion** ($0 or $X) - mental-overflow.md, notes
   - **iPhone Notes** ($0) - Quick captures
   - **[Your embodiment coach]** ($X/session) - Staying grounded

   **Total monthly: ~$[X]**

3. **What I DON'T use** (and why):
   - ❌ CRM software (WhatsApp + spreadsheet works)
   - ❌ Marketing automation (want human touch)
   - ❌ Analytics tools (LinkedIn native is enough)
   - ❌ Project management tools (Notion + WhatsApp is enough for 12-16 people)
   - ❌ Ads platforms (spent $0 on ads, built through community)

4. **What matters vs what doesn't**:
   - Tools don't matter. Showing up daily matters.
   - Fancy stack doesn't matter. Caring about people matters.
   - Automation doesn't matter (yet). Personal touch matters.

5. **When I'll upgrade**:
   - If cohorts scale past 16 people: Maybe CRM
   - If community grows past 100: Maybe Slack/Discord
   - For now: Keep it simple, keep it human

6. **The insight**: Start with free/cheap tools. Upgrade when pain is real, not theoretical.

7. **Vulnerable moment**: "I spent $200/mo on tools for my last startup. Used 20% of features. Now I run MOMENTUM on $[X]/mo. Lean is liberating."

8. **NO MOMENTUM TIE-IN**: Pure value post

9. **CTA**: "What's your lean tech stack? Drop it in comments—curious what others use."

**Why this works**:
- Tuesday = high reach for tactical content
- Everyone wants to know tools successful people use
- Transparency (shows you don't need fancy tools)
- Actionable (they can copy your stack)
- Shareable (people love tech stack breakdowns)
- Builds authority (you've figured out what works)

---

### **Wed, Nov 20 - WEEK 1 ENERGY (FIRST CHECK-IN)**
**Post Type**: Behind-the-Scenes (Pillar 2)
**Format**: Short-form (400-600 words)
**Target Score**: 76-82/100
**Expected Reach**: Moderate (Wednesday) - community building

**Hook**:
"We're 3 days into Cohort #4. Here's what's happening in the WhatsApp group."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Real-time update
2. **The energy**:
   - Someone shipped their first landing page (in 3 days!)
   - Someone talked to 5 potential customers already
   - Someone killed their original idea, pivoting to something better
   - Someone asked for help, got 7 responses in 10 minutes
3. **Screenshot** (if possible): Anonymized WhatsApp showing support / wins
4. **What I'm noticing**:
   - Week 1 energy is high (always is)
   - Everyone's ambitious goals feel scary (good)
   - Already helping each other (this is why peer community > solo)
5. **What's coming**:
   - Week 2: Reality hits, customer interviews don't go as planned
   - Week 3: The messy middle (this is where I catch people)
   - Week 4: Momentum returns (breakthroughs start)
   - Week 5: Demo day (everyone shows up, ready or not)
6. **For everyone watching**:
   - I'll keep sharing the journey
   - Wins, struggles, lessons learned
   - Next cohort: Feb 2025 (DM for waitlist)
7. **MOMENTUM tie-in**: Natural (documenting cohort)
8. **CTA**: "Following along? What do you want to see from behind-the-scenes? Comment below."

**Why this works**:
- Wednesday = moderate reach, community-building content
- Shows real progress (social proof for next cohort)
- Transparent (not just wins, also pivots)
- Builds anticipation for next cohort
- Engages audience in the journey

---

### **[FUTURE] - BREAKING THROUGH EMOTIONAL INERTIA**
**Post Type**: Founder Journey (Pillar 1)
**Format**: Long-form (700-900 words)
**Target Score**: 80-85/100
**Expected Reach**: Variable (use strategically post-launch)
**When to use**: After cohort starts, when you want to address deeper emotional blocks

**Hook**:
"The hardest part of building isn't the idea, the code, or the customers. It's breaking through your own emotional inertia."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Counter-intuitive truth
2. **What is emotional inertia**:
   - That heavy feeling when you know what to do but can't start
   - The resistance between "I should do this" and actually doing it
   - The invisible weight that keeps you in "someday" mode
3. **Where it shows up for builders**:
   - You've had the same idea for 18 months but haven't talked to a single customer
   - You've written the business plan but haven't sent a single cold email
   - You've designed the logo but haven't validated if anyone wants this
   - You know what the next step is, you just... can't
4. **Why it happens**:
   - Fear of judgment ("what if people think this is stupid?")
   - Fear of failure ("what if I try and it doesn't work?")
   - Fear of success ("what if it works and my life changes?")
   - Attachment to the perfect version in your head
5. **The real problem**:
   - Emotional inertia disguises itself as "not ready yet"
   - It sounds like: "I need to learn X first" or "I'll start next month"
   - But it's actually: "I'm scared to find out if this matters"
6. **How to break through** (from coaching 40 builders):
   - **Step 1**: Name it. Say out loud: "I'm avoiding this because I'm scared."
   - **Step 2**: Make the smallest possible move. Not "launch MVP"—just "send 1 email."
   - **Step 3**: Do it badly. Give yourself permission for messy, imperfect action.
   - **Step 4**: Create external pressure. Tell someone "I'll do X by Friday."
7. **Real example** (anonymized):
   - Builder had idea for 2 years, never acted
   - Week 1 of MOMENTUM: "I'm stuck, can't start"
   - Me: "What if you just sent 1 email to 1 person asking about their pain?"
   - Them: "Just one? That I can do."
   - Result: Sent 1, then 5, then 20. Had 3 pre-sales by Week 4.
8. **The breakthrough moment**:
   - It's not when you have the perfect plan
   - It's when you do the first imperfect thing
   - Movement creates momentum (that's why it's called MOMENTUM)
9. **Vulnerable moment**:
   - "I've had emotional inertia around launching MOMENTUM itself."
   - "I knew I should do it. Took me 6 months to actually announce Cohort #1."
   - "The only thing that broke through: Telling 3 people 'I'm doing this' and setting a date."
10. **The lesson**: You don't need to feel ready. You need to move.
11. **MOMENTUM tie-in** (soft): "This is why we have demo day. External deadline + peer pressure = inertia breaker."
12. **CTA**: "What are you avoiding right now? Name it in the comments. (Sometimes just saying it out loud breaks the spell.)"

**Why this works**:
- Addresses root cause (emotion, not tactics)
- Permission to be imperfect
- Real breakthrough = relatable
- Shows why structure/community matters
- Can be used anytime post-launch as evergreen content

**Strategic timing options**:
- Use during cohort to show what builders are working through
- Use between cohorts as evergreen content
- Use when you see engagement dip (emotional content re-engages)

---

## Campaign Tactics

### Urgency Mechanics
- **Spots countdown**: Start at 12-16 spots, count down daily (Nov 11: update with real numbers)
- **Time countdown**: Days until start (Nov 14-17: "3 days" → "2 days" → "48 hours" → "today")
- **Social proof**: Reference past cohorts, 40+ builders, 38/40 metric, specific transformations
- **Visual proof**: Stripe screenshot (Nov 11), kick-off call screenshot (Nov 17)

### Engagement Drivers
- **Reply to every comment** within first 2 hours
- **Move interested commenters to DMs** ("Thanks for engaging! Want to chat about your idea? DM me")
- **Respond to DMs fast** (within 1 hour during business hours)
- **Engage proactively**: Comment on 20-30 builder posts daily (meaningful, not "great post!")

### Content Mix Balance (18-post campaign)
- **MOMENTUM Program (Pillar 2)**: 7 posts (39%) - Launch focused
- **Framework (Pillar 3)**: 5 posts (28%) - Keep value high
- **Founder Journey (Pillar 1)**: 4 posts (22%) - Build trust through vulnerability
- **Behind-the-Scenes (Pillar 2)**: 2 posts (11%) - Transparency

### LinkedIn Performance Timing Strategy
- **Weekends (Sat/Sun)**: Lower reach → Relationship-building, BTS, lighter content
- **Mon-Tue**: Moderate reach → Tactical frameworks, lessons learned
- **Wed-Fri**: Peak reach → Strongest hooks, emotional stories, urgency

### CTA Evolution
- **Nov 3-5**: No CTA / soft CTA (story-setting, no selling)
- **Nov 6-8**: "DM me 'COHORT' to apply"
- **Nov 9-11**: Add spot countdown ("X spots left")
- **Nov 12-15**: Add time countdown ("X days until we start")
- **Nov 16**: Pure urgency ("48 hours. Last chance.")
- **Nov 17+**: Switch to waitlist ("DM me 'WAITLIST' for Feb 2025")

### Visual Assets to Prepare
- **Nov 11**: Screenshot of Stripe payment notifications (real, not staged)
- **Nov 17**: Screenshot from kick-off call (faces blurred for privacy)
- **Nov 9** (optional): Anonymized WhatsApp conversation screenshots
- **Nov 20** (optional): WhatsApp wins/support screenshots

### Key Messaging Themes
1. **Stakes over information**: You're not buying content, you're buying commitment
2. **Community over solo**: Peer accountability catches you when you want to hide
3. **Action over perfection**: Demo day isn't about polished, it's about shipping
4. **Fast kills**: Killing bad ideas in Week 2 = time to find right idea
5. **Scared but ready**: Everyone who joins is scared. That's normal. Start anyway.

## Success Metrics

### Primary Goal
**12-16 quality applications** from target ICP:
- Founders (60%): 7-10 applications
- Career Changers (30%): 4-5 applications
- Intrapreneurs (10%): 1-2 applications

### Secondary Goals
- **Engagement**: Avg 75+ score per post, 10+ meaningful comments per post
- **DM conversations**: 20-30 quality conversations
- **Profile growth**: +100 followers from target audience
- **Waitlist**: 10-15 people for Feb 2025 cohort

### Leading Indicators (Track Daily)
- **Post score**: Self-score each post before publishing (aim 75+ average)
- **Comments**: Are founders engaging? What questions?
- **DMs**: Quality > quantity (looking for "this is me" signals)
- **Shares**: Are people tagging friends?

## Post-Campaign Actions

### After Nov 17
1. **Switch to documenting journey**: Share wins, struggles, breakthroughs from Cohort #4
2. **Build social proof**: Capture testimonials, quick wins, transformation moments
3. **Start Feb 2025 waitlist**: Nurture with behind-the-scenes content
4. **Analyze performance**: Which posts drove most applications? What content resonated?

### Content After Launch
- **2x/week**: Behind-the-scenes from current cohort
- **2x/week**: Framework/tactical value posts
- **1x/week**: Personal journey/lifestyle
- All posts: Soft CTA for Feb 2025 waitlist

---

## Emergency Adjustments

### If getting low applications by Nov 12:
- **Double down on transformation stories** (career changer quitting job, $2k builder)
- **Add 1-2 extra urgency posts** ("Only 3 spots, considering closing early")
- **Increase DM outreach** (proactively reach out to engaged followers)
- **Create urgency hook**: "Considering running smaller cohort (8 people) for more intimacy"

### If getting too many applications:
- **Create waitlist early** ("12 spots filled, opening waitlist for overflow")
- **Consider expanding to 16** (if quality is high)
- **Build FOMO**: "Waitlist is growing, Feb cohort may fill fast"

### If engagement is low:
- **Increase vulnerability** (more founder journey, less framework)
- **Simplify CTAs** (just "DM me", remove "COHORT" keyword)
- **Post at different times** (test morning vs evening)
- **Engage more proactively** (comment on 30 posts/day, not 20)

## Notes

- **Authenticity > polish**: Don't over-optimize. Your best posts feel like WhatsApp messages to fellow builders.
- **Vulnerability wins**: The posts with most conversion are vulnerable founder journey + tactical framework combos.
- **Urgency is real**: You genuinely have limited spots. Don't manufacture scarcity—communicate real constraints.
- **Engage like crazy**: First 2 hours after posting = critical. Reply to everyone.
- **Trust the system**: You've scored/analyzed your past posts. Stick to 75+ threshold. Don't publish 60s.

---

## Final Reminder

**Your superpower**: Vulnerable storytelling + tactical systems.

When you combine both (story + framework), that's when magic happens.

**Your best post makes a founder at 2am think:**
> "This person gets exactly what I'm going through. I need to join MOMENTUM."
