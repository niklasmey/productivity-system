## 📖 MY STORY

### Section Header
**"Why I built MOMENTUM"**

### Headline
**"Connecting people, building freedom"**

---

### Story Copy (Expanded from current page)

For years, I kept pushing my dreams into the future.

I had ideas I didn't build. Moves I didn't make. I waited for permission that never came—and hid behind excuses to protect my ego.

Building solo kept me stuck in the same patterns.

I knew community was the answer. So I started hosting 5-week sprints—bringing together peers who said YES to one idea and committed to building alongside each other.

After running three cohorts, something clicked. This wasn't just a side project anymore. It was a proven system for helping founders, intrapreneurs, and career changers make **undeniable progress** together.

That's when MOMENTUM became real.

Through workshops, I provide the structure. The group fills it with sharp feedback and real support. Together, we turn dreams into momentum.

But here's what I've learned after 40+ builders:

**Personal freedom isn't about going solo. It's about building with the right people.**

It's about courage, creativity, and bold actions—taken together.

That's what we do here. And I'd love to build alongside you.

### What "Personal Freedom" Means

**For me, personal freedom means:**

→ **Building on your own terms** - No one else's timeline, no permission needed

→ **Turning ideas into income** - Creating cash-flowing businesses that support the life you want

→ **Choosing your community** - Working with people who energize you, not drain you

And it starts with 5 weeks of focused momentum.

## ❓ FAQ

### Section Header
**"Frequently Asked Questions"**

---

**Q: I'm not technical, can I still join?**

A: Absolutely! MOMENTUM is for any dedicated builder, including no-code founders, service providers, and career changers looking for their next role. All you need is a bias to action and a readiness to ship!

---

**Q: How do you measure Most Progress?**

A: At the end of the sprint, each participant reviews everyone's projects and ranks them by progress made. Then, we combine the peer rankings with your actual completion rate to calculate a final progress score. Whoever ends up with the highest score wins the Most Progress Award.

---

**Q: Do you offer payment plans?**

A: MOMENTUM is all about co-creation! If the $500 CAD program fee represents a barrier for you, please reach out to me at nik@momentum.builders. We offer discounts and even fully sponsored seats based on location and personal situation.

---

**Q: What's the schedule?**

A: Our sessions are scheduled to accommodate global time zones, with a focus on North America and Europe. Workshops are on Mondays at 8:30am PST / 11:30am EST / 5:30pm CET for 60 min. Coworking sessions are on Wednesdays at 8:30am PST / 11:30am EST / 5:30pm CET for 90 min. Your 1:1 check-in with me is on Fridays and we will set a time based on your availability.

---

**Q: How much time am I committing per week?**

A: 3 hours per week across 5 weeks. The sessions aren't about consuming information, they're about making progress on your project with structure and support.

---

**Q: What if I can't make a session live?**

A: All sessions are recorded and you get lifetime access to replays in the Momentum Builders platform. Individual work and reflection prompts are also available there, so you can catch up async and stay on track.

---

**Q: What happens after the 5 weeks?**

A: For most builders, the first sprint is just the beginning. Many string together 3 to 4 sprints until their path forward is crystal clear and their business idea is fully validated, while others continue with 1:1 coaching or join future cohorts at a discount. The real power is in seeing your progress compound over time.
