Today is to celebrate 6 weeks of undeniable progress:
• Extracted 100,000 size vectors from Reddit comments
• Hosted a 6-week sprint for 15+ early-stage AI founders
• Vibed-coded a delivery + try-on window predictor, decoding complex shipping and return policies
• Hosted various virtual + IRL coworking sessions, dedicating Wednesdays to marketing + distribution
• Vibed-coded a MOMENTUM tracker, bringing objectives and key results to solo builders
• Incorporated a new business and formed partnerships to strengthen its offering
• Posted on LinkedIn about 2 times per week (time to get consistent)
• Expanded the product vision for my AI shopping companion
• Facilitated 100+ check-ins with early-stage AI founders
• Built a new personal website with Framer

Who said you can't have founder energy and operate at startup speed while living in a tourist town in the mountains?

Lots of learnings, insights, reminders, and new skills to share..

But for now, I'm off for two 4-day weekends to recharge and regroup.

Our next 6-week Sprint starts Sep 29!

And, I'm doubling down on the program by adding more group experiences, introducing objectives and key results, and building a MOMENTUM tracker.

DM me to apply early!
