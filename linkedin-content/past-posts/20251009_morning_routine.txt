I never thought I'd change my morning routine. Then vibe-coding came into my life!

What used to be breath work + working out is now breath work + vibe coding.

Here's my new morning ritual!

The night before I:
• Pick my top product item from Linear
• Write the emotions I want users to feel at the top of a paper
• Pre-load VS Code with Claude Code

The next morning I:
• Ground myself with 30min+ of self-guided breath work
• Pick up that paper and map out how to create that feeling (wireframes, interactions, copy, etc.)
• Build with meditative focus and absolute clarity

Night me defines the feeling. Morning me figures out how to build it.

No messages, no emails, no news, no food in the way!

Just 100% of my cognitive + emotional capacity directed toward building a truly lovable experience.

For some, this comes naturally!

For me, this level of structure and rigor is what unlocks my creativity.

And, the best part?

It scratches my daily itch of polishing and improving my product!

Starting like that makes everything else so much easier.

Especially the hard, needle-moving work my businesses actually need.

P.S. Yes! I start my days very early, which I got from my German dad.
