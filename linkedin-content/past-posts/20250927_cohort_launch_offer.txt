🔥 Opening 7 spots to the public for our next 6-week Sprint! 🔥

Lock-in alongside 10+ early-stage founders from Sep 29 to Nov 7, driving real traction and building toward personal freedom!

What started as the antidote to my blockers and fears building an AI shopping companion is now a supportive community for sharp, driven builders.

Here's the proven framework we use to make undeniable progress:
• OKRs - Make your vision measurable, track real results
• Standups - Declare your key action items every Monday
• Coworking - Create marketing content every Wednesday
• Weekly 1:1s - Receive personal guidance from me every Friday
• WhatsApp group - Access peer support whenever you need it
• Commitment - Stay accountable with a stake and public demo day

Whether you've been sitting on an idea, have a half-finished POC, or are finally ready to launch, it's time to become a MOMENTUM Builder!!!
