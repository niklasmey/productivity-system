# Cohort #4 FLEXIBLE / CONDITIONAL POSTS

> These posts don't have fixed dates. Use them strategically based on how the campaign is going.

---

## WHEN TO USE THESE

- **Double-post days**: If needed, post 4+ hours apart from main scheduled post
- **Based on metrics**: Stripe screenshot only if payments are rolling in
- **Success stories**: Only if testimonials come through with permission
- **Fill gaps**: If a scheduled post doesn't feel right, swap in one of these

## FLEX POST #1: STRIPE SCREENSHOT (Social Proof)

**When to use**: When you have 5+ payments and want to create FOMO
**Format**: Super short (3 lines + image)
**Target Score**: 77-82/100

**Hook**:
"My inbox this morning. [Screenshot of Stripe payment notifications]"

**Body** (keep it minimal):
"Cohort #4 is filling up faster than I expected.

Each notification = someone who decided to stop waiting.

[X spots left]. Nov 17."

**CTA**: "DM me 'COHORT' if you've been on the fence."

**Why this works**:
- Visual proof (real payments, not claims)
- Short = scrollable, not salesy
- Creates FOMO (others are committing)
- Can post any day once payments start rolling in

**Note**: Only post if you ACTUALLY have payments. Authenticity > everything.

## FLEX POST #2: SUCCESS STORY - MEHDI

**When to use**: If Mehdi gives permission + compelling before/after
**Format**: Medium-form (500-700 words)
**Target Score**: 82-87/100

**Hook**:
"Got this message from Mehdi after Cohort #3. Sharing with permission..."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook**: Let him speak
2. **His words**: Direct quote or screenshot
3. **Before**: Where he was (specific situation)
4. **After**: Where he is now (specific outcome)
5. **What made the difference**: His POV (not yours)
6. **NO HEAVY MOMENTUM TIE-IN**: The testimonial speaks for itself
7. **CTA**: "Cohort #4 starts Nov 17. DM me 'COHORT' if this resonates."

**Strategic timing**:
- Best on high-reach days (Tue-Fri)
- Can double-post 4+ hours after main content
- Save for when you need social proof boost

## FLEX POST #5: 10 COWORKING SESSIONS HOSTED

**When to use**: Mid-campaign, when you want to show effort/value
**Format**: Short-medium (400-600 words)
**Target Score**: 78-83/100

**Hook**:
"I've hosted 10 coworking sessions for builders over 4 cohorts. Here's what I've learned about why they work."

**Structure**:
1. **The setup**: What coworking sessions are
   - Wednesday afternoons, 2 hours
   - Everyone working on their thing, together
   - Not presentations—just parallel work + support
2. **Why they work** (insights from 10 sessions):
   - Body doubling: Having others working = you work harder
   - Immediate help: Stuck? Ask the room, get unstuck in 5 min
   - Accountability: Said you'd do something? Now do it with witnesses
   - Energy: Solo building is draining. Group energy is contagious.
3. **What actually happens**:
   - Someone ships landing page live in the session
   - Someone does customer interview with group listening
   - Someone asks "does this messaging make sense?" and gets instant feedback
   - Someone just needs the push to START
4. **Why not just async**:
   - Async = easy to hide
   - Live = nowhere to hide, in the best way
   - The magic is the real-time energy
5. **Vulnerable moment**: "I started these because I hated building alone. Turns out, so does everyone else."
6. **MOMENTUM tie-in**: "We do this every Wednesday. Nov 17-Dec 17."
7. **CTA**: "Want in? DM me 'COHORT'."

**Best timing**: Mon-Wed

## FLEX POST #6: 250+ 1:1 CHECK-INS WITH BUILDERS

**When to use**: When you want to show depth of coaching
**Format**: Medium-form (600-800 words)
**Target Score**: 80-85/100

**Hook**:
"I've done 250+ one-on-one check-ins with builders over 4 cohorts. Here's what almost everyone gets wrong."

**Structure**:
1. **The setup**: What 1:1s are
   - Friday afternoon, 15-30 min each
   - Every builder, every week
   - Not just "how's it going?"—specific progress checks
2. **The pattern I see** (across 250+ check-ins):
   - Week 1: Everyone's optimistic ("I've got this!")
   - Week 2: Reality check ("This is harder than I thought")
   - Week 3: Crisis point ("Maybe I should quit")
   - Week 4: Breakthrough ("Oh, I see it now")
   - Week 5: Relief ("I actually did it")
3. **What almost everyone gets wrong**:
   - They think Week 3 crisis = failure
   - Actually: Week 3 crisis = you're doing it right
   - The messy middle is SUPPOSED to feel messy
   - That's when you need support most
4. **What I do in these check-ins**:
   - Week 1-2: Help them scope down (they always start too big)
   - Week 3: Catch them when they want to quit (this is critical)
   - Week 4-5: Help them ship something, anything
5. **Real examples** (anonymized):
   - Builder Week 3: "I haven't made progress. Should I drop out?"
   - Me: "You talked to 15 customers this week. That IS progress."
   - They stayed. They shipped.

   - Builder Week 5: "It's not perfect, I can't demo this."
   - Me: "Demo day isn't about perfect. It's about done."
   - They demoed. It was amazing.
6. **Vulnerable moment**: "I've been the person in Week 3 who wanted to quit. That's why I know how to catch you."
7. **Why 1:1s matter**:
   - Group calls = you can hide
   - 1:1s = nowhere to hide, I see you
   - That's the accountability that actually works
8. **MOMENTUM tie-in**: "Every builder gets weekly 1:1s. Nov 17-Dec 17."
9. **CTA**: "Want this level of support? DM me 'COHORT'."

**Best timing**: Tue-Thu (peak reach days)

## USAGE GUIDELINES

1. **Don't force them**: Only use if they feel authentic and timely
2. **Double-posting**: Wait 4+ hours between posts (morning + evening)
3. **Stripe screenshot**: Only if you actually have 5+ payments
4. **Success stories**: Only with explicit permission
5. **Save for strategic moments**: When main post is weaker, use these to supplement

---

## STRATEGIC USE CASES

**Scenario 1: Applications are slow**
- Use Stripe screenshot (if you have payments) to create FOMO
- Use success stories to show social proof
- Use coworking/1:1 posts to show value

**Scenario 2: Need to fill final spots fast**
- Stripe screenshot + "X spots left"
- Success story that resonates with your unfilled ICP

**Scenario 3: Want to boost a weaker day**
- Double-post a success story 4 hours after main post
- Or swap in coworking/1:1 post for more value

---

## KEY POINT

These are your ACE CARDS. Don't play them all at once. Use them strategically when the campaign needs a boost.
