### Expanded Story (Sub-page - Click to read more)

{Hi, I'm Nik!}

I build tools, stories, and spaces to bring people together and unlock their full potential.

---

For years, I kept pushing my dreams into the future. I had ideas I didn't build. Moves I didn't make. I waited for permission that never came and hid behind excuses to protect my ego.

It took me 3 years of entrepreneurship to finally break through those patterns.

---

June 23, 2024 was when I finally felt a big shift! I started finding paying customers before building anything. Vibe-coded features people actually wanted. Killed bad ideas without any emotional attachment.

What happened that day? I kicked off the inaugural sprint with a few of my local entrepreneur friends.

---

Four sprints forward and inspired by Lovable, I turned all my learnings into MOMENTUM so you can go straight to impact and income with your business ideas.

MOMENTUM is an indie accelerator that reminds people of their human potential.

It helps anyone turn a personal pain point, deep domain expertise, or zone of genius into a path toward personal freedom.

It pairs peer communities with my German-engineered system to test ideas from 0 to 1.

---

Before and after work, you'll find me making art and furniture, preparing for a bold expedition, and talking to strangers.

{Thanks for building alongside me!

Happy days,
Nik

## ❓ FAQ

### Section Header
**"Frequently Asked Questions"**

---

**Q: I'm not technical, can I still join?**

A: Absolutely! MOMENTUM is for any dedicated builder, including no-code founders, service providers, and career changers looking for their next role. All you need is a bias to action and a readiness to ship!

---

**Q: How do you measure Most Progress?**

A: At the end of the sprint, each participant reviews everyone's projects and ranks them by progress made. Then, we combine the peer rankings with your actual completion rate to calculate a final progress score. Whoever ends up with the highest score wins the Most Progress Award.

---

**Q: Do you offer payment plans?**

A: MOMENTUM is all about co-creation! If the $500 CAD program fee represents a barrier for you, please reach out to me at nik@momentum.builders. We offer discounts and even fully sponsored seats based on location and personal situation.

---

**Q: What's the schedule?**

A: Our sessions are scheduled to accommodate global time zones, with a focus on North America and Europe. Workshops are on Mondays at 8:30am PST / 11:30am EST / 5:30pm CET for 60 min. Coworking sessions are on Wednesdays at 8:30am PST / 11:30am EST / 5:30pm CET for 90 min. Your 1:1 check-in with me is on Fridays and we will set a time based on your availability.

---

**Q: How much time am I committing per week?**

A: 3 hours per week across 5 weeks. The sessions aren't about consuming information, they're about making progress on your project with structure and support.

---

**Q: What if I can't make a session live?**

A: All sessions are recorded and you get lifetime access to replays in the Momentum Builders platform. Individual work and reflection prompts are also available there, so you can catch up async and stay on track.

---

**Q: What happens after the 5 weeks?**

A: For most builders, the first sprint is just the beginning. Many string together 3 to 4 sprints until their path forward is crystal clear and their business idea is fully validated, while others continue with 1:1 coaching or join future cohorts at a discount. The real power is in seeing your progress compound over time.
