Have you ever felt like you were building a personal prison, locking yourself in, and handing the keys away?

Last week, I was sick, and this feeling crept up on me.

Since spring, I've been validating two business ideas in parallel.

While I love these early explorative days, splitting my focus reached its end.

I usually only get sick when I'm at a crossroads, so it was time to choose which one had to go:

My AI shopping companion is a tool that uses real fit data to provide one-click size predictions when shopping clothes online.

As I started fundraising for it, that's when the prison feeling hit.

I saw myself locked in for years, handing the keys to investors.

No stranger to commitment and risk, the opportunity I created didn't feel right.

I realized I was doing it for the wrong reasons!

I was betting on a hypothesis for a problem space I'd already explored deeply, simply because I knew it well and it didn't yet feel complete.

And frankly, the org and ops required to realize the full vision of answering every fit, style, and size question felt beyond where I'm at right now as an entrepreneur.

But I'm thankful for the experience!

It got me into vibe-coding and taught me how to prototype fast, implement AI agents and chats, and build multi-step automations.

It gave me crucial mindset reframes, like assuming permission, progress > perfection, moving dreams forward in time, and prioritizing off of anti-goals.

And it let me grieve the AI try-on startup I stepped out of and the business partnership that broke with it.

So, I freed myself up to go all-in on the project that excites me, is already generating revenue, and challenges me to grow where I need it most.

After all, I wanna build communities and solve their hard problems with tech for decades to come.

There is no exit plan.

It's a pursuit of personal freedom!

Tomorrow, I'll share what started as a side project called INFINITE RUNWAY and is now my full focus!
