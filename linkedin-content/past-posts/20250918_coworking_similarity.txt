Early-stage founders unite! Wednesday is the day to relentlessly execute on your marketing!!

Today, we gathered on the SIMILARITY principle of influence for our second coworking session.

The idea is to assimilate with your niche and learn its unique culture code by replicating what's already working.

For both new and dormant accounts, it repositions your content in front of the algorithm and reignites your connection with the audience.

So, Daniela Redding and I asked the builders on our group call to find at least 6 outlier posts/formats in their niche and analyze why they're outperforming.

And because speed matters when founding, we encouraged everyone to pick formats they can easily iterate on with resources available to them RIGHT NOW!!

Everyone walked away with a repository full of ideas, the energy to prioritize distribution, and many shared learnings.

Next week, we'll get into recreating these formats for our accounts, turning our coworking sessions into an AI tool playground. 👀

For anyone following along outside the calls or getting ahead of our schedule, make sure you add your own spin and tie in your offer.

(Forgot the latter once on a 100k+ view IG reel 🙈😅 Don't be me!!)
