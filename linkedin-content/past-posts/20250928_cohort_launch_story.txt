The dream I thought was years away became reality this summer!

6 years ago, I had this crazy idea: gather 5-6 students for a year, remove every barrier or gatekeeper in their way, and help them solve the world's hardest problems.

But I kept adding requirements to myself, like saving more money, earning more credentials, and being more "ready" (whatever that is …)

And the dream seemed to be moving further and further into the future.

Then AI changed everything. Suddenly, there were no more external barriers to building anything.

Now, it was just me, my agency, and I to make it happen.

(It probably always was like that.)

So, after years of pushing it away, I just moved it forward into the now.

While building my AI shopping companion, I German-engineered the exact system I wish I had when I started as an entrepreneur.

Together, we lock-in from Sep 29 to Nov 7, make undeniable progress, and build with MOMENTUM toward our dreams!

If one of yours has been stuck in someday, let's move it forward in time.
