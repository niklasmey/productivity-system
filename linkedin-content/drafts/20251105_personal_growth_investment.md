## Draft V3 (FINAL - Ready to Publish)

I spend 14% of my 2025 income on personal growth. And I'm budgeting $20,000 for next year!

Here are all the coaches + experiences I've invested in:
→ Emotional self-leadership = Bi-weekly check-ins with long-term mentor.
→ Nervous system regulation = Deepened my breathwork studies/practice and got into Qi Gong.
→ Public speaking/performing = The first half was all about improv acting, and now I'm learning two different dances.

→ Communication = Lots of solo-practice and listening back at the group calls or 1:1 calls I've facilitated (cringe..)

→ Business coaching = Pivoting into running community programs for entrepreneurs had me reconnect with a mentor who coached entrepreneurs for 5 decades. He's watching almost every step I take!

→ Personal training = Climbing is a huge part of my identity. Yet, I haven't broken into the elusive 5.12s SMH! No stranger to working out rigorously and consistently, I'm getting guidance on facing my weaknesses.

→ Nature-based + indigenous teachings = Attended 2 retreats and 6 ceremonies to connect with the people that belonged to where I'm living for millennia.

✚ Over 1,000 unpaid hours mastering skills I'm convinced will be best-paid in 5 years:
- Community-building
- Vibe-coding
- Taste

✚ Working with the 40+ incredibly sharp and driven MOMENTUM Builders that joined my sprints.

This is not about knowing more! It's about shifting habits, mindset, and patterns.

It's about finding your zones of genius and reassembling your best parts.

That's why most of it is experiential, because it's how I learn best and how my growth actually lasts.

Equivocally, it was the lowest income year since I moved to Canada.

And, I haven't yet turned this AI gold rush into F*ck You money.

But I certainly shifted my trajectory by several degrees upwards.

It will have tremendous ripple effects throughout the rest of my life.

The lifetime ROI of my 2025 will be MASSIVE!

So, Invest in Yourself!

Because if I know one thing it's that our impact + income grows when we do! It even compounds faster with the right peers + systems.

Turn on notifications for my account.

Be first in line when our next @MOMENTUM sprint drops tomorrow.

The experiential program I created out of all my growing.

4 of 12 spots are already filled.

## Initial Analysis

### What's Working ✓

1. **Strong hook** - 14% → 20% is specific and surprising
2. **Vulnerable** - "lowest income year" paired with massive investment is bold
3. **List format** - Easy to scan, shows breadth of investment
4. **Authentic voice** - "cringe", "SMH", casual tone feels real
5. **MOMENTUM tie-in** - Natural mention of 40+ builders
6. **Philosophical depth** - "finding zones of genius and re-assembling your best parts"

### Issues to Address ⚠️

#### 1. **Logical Flow Problems**

**Line 1-2:** "This year I spend 14%"
- Tense inconsistency: "spend" (present) vs "This year" (suggests past/complete)
- Should be: "This year I **spent**" OR "In 2025 I spent"

**Line 3:** "Here all the coaches"
- Missing word: "Here **are** all the coaches"

**Arrow inconsistency:**
- Mix of → and —> (should be consistent)

**Line: "This not about knowing more!"**
- Missing word: "This **is** not about"

**Line: "I may haven't turned"**
- Grammar issue: "I may **not** have turned" OR "I haven't turned"

**Line: "several degree upwards"**
- Should be plural: "several **degrees** upwards"

**Line: "Equivocally"**
- Word is correct, though "Ironically" or "Paradoxically" might land better

#### 2. **Structural Issues**

**The list is overwhelming:**
- 7 different arrows (→) followed by 2 plus signs (✚)
- Hard to track what's what
- Consider grouping or simplifying

**The ending feels scattered:**
- Jumps from "experiential learning" → "no F*ck You money" → "trajectory shifted" → "lowest income" → "ROI must be massive"
- These ideas need better connective tissue

**CTA is weak:**
- "Anyways, Invest in Yourself!" feels tacked on
- No clear action for reader

#### 3. **Coherence Gaps**

**Gap between list and insight:**
- You list 7+ investments, then say "This not about knowing more"
- But you never told us it WAS about knowing more—bridge missing

**"F*ck You money" line:**
- Feels defensive/apologetic
- Undercuts the confident "shifted trajectory" claim
- Consider reframing as intentional choice vs. failure

**Timeline confusion:**
- "This year" + "2025" + "lowest income year since I moved to Canada"
- When did you move to Canada? (2019 per previous post)
- Are we at end of 2025 or middle? Context needed

#### 4. **Tone Inconsistencies**

**Confident → Apologetic → Confident:**
- Start: Bold investment claim
- Middle: "cringe", "SMH", "may haven't turned"
- End: "trajectory shifted", "MASSIVE ROI"
- The apologetic middle undercuts your message

## Line-by-Line Logical Analysis

**LINE 1-2:** "This year I spend 14% of my income on personal growth. And, I'm budgeting 20% for 2026!"
- ⚠️ Tense: "spend" should be "spent"
- ⚠️ "And, I'm" - comma after "And" is unnecessary
- ✓ Hook is strong (specific percentages)

**LINE 3:** "Because if I know one thing it's that our impact + income grows when we do!"
- ✓ Clear thesis
- ⚠️ Consider: "it's that" → "it's this:" (stronger)

**LINE 4:** "Here all the coaches + experiences I've invested:"
- ⚠️ Missing "are" - should be "Here are all"
- ⚠️ "invested:" should specify "invested in:" for clarity

**LIST ITEMS:**
- ⚠️ Arrow inconsistency (→ vs —>)
- ⚠️ Some are too long (Personal training = 3 sentences)
- ⚠️ Format inconsistency (some explain, some just list)

**LINE: "✚ Over 1,000 unpaid hours mastering skills I'm convinced will be best-paid in 5 years:"**
- ✓ Interesting claim
- ⚠️ "best-paid" is awkward - maybe "most valuable" or "highest-paid"
- ⚠️ Why shift from → to ✚? What's the difference?

**LINE: "✚ Working with the 40+ incredibly sharp and driven MOMENTUM Builders"**
- ⚠️ Is this an investment you made or work you did?
- ⚠️ Doesn't fit the pattern (you didn't "invest" in builders, they invested in you)

**LINE: "This not about knowing more!"**
- ⚠️ Missing "is"
- ⚠️ What's the "this" referring to? The transition is abrupt

**LINE: "It's about shifting habits, mindset, and patterns."**
- ✓ Clear
- ✓ Good parallel structure

**LINE: "It's about finding your zones of genius and re-assembling your best parts."**
- ✓ Poetic, strong
- ⚠️ "re-assembling" - hyphen unnecessary: "reassembling"

**LINE: "That's why most of it is experiential, because it's how I learn best and how my growth actually lasts."**
- ✓ Good insight
- ⚠️ "most of it is experiential" - but you listed mentors, coaches, ceremonies... what's NOT experiential?

**LINE: "I may haven't turned this AI gold rush into F*ck You money."**
- ⚠️ Grammar: "may haven't" should be "may not have" or just "haven't"
- ⚠️ Tonal shift - suddenly defensive
- ⚠️ "AI gold rush" - why mention this? No prior context about AI

**LINE: "But I certainly shifted my trajectory by several degree upwards."**
- ⚠️ "degree" should be "degrees"
- ✓ Confidence returns

**LINE: "With tremendous ripple effects throughout the rest of my life."**
- ✓ Good, but vague - what ripple effects?

**LINE: "Equivically, it was the lowest income year since I moved to Canada.."**
- ⚠️ "Equivically" - not a word (Ironically? Paradoxically?)
- ⚠️ Double period
- ⚠️ This undercuts your argument - are you proud or apologizing?

**LINE: "So, I guess the lifetime ROI of my 2025 must be MASSIVE! :D"**
- ⚠️ "I guess" weakens the claim
- ⚠️ ":D" emoticon feels out of place for LinkedIn
- ✓ "lifetime ROI" is a good reframe

**LINE: "Anyways, Invest in Yourself!"**
- ⚠️ "Anyways" is dismissive
- ⚠️ Generic CTA, no clear action

---

## Biggest Issues to Fix

### 1. **Grammar & Typos (Must Fix)**
- "spend" → "spent"
- "Here all" → "Here are all"
- "This not" → "This is not"
- "I may haven't" → "I haven't" or "I may not have"
- "several degree" → "several degrees"
- "Equivically" → "Ironically" or "Paradoxically"
- "re-assembling" → "reassembling"

### 2. **Structural Problems**
- **List is too long/scattered** - Consider grouping into 3-4 categories
- **Ending is confused** - Pick one frame: proud or apologetic, not both
- **CTA is weak** - No clear action for reader

### 3. **Tonal Inconsistencies**
- Starts confident → becomes apologetic → returns confident
- "F*ck You money" line feels defensive
- "I guess" undercuts your thesis

### 4. **Logical Gaps**
- Why mention AI gold rush with no context?
- "40+ MOMENTUM Builders" - is this an investment or your work?
- "Experiential" claim unclear (what isn't experiential?)

---

## Suggested Reframe

### Option A: Own the Low-Income Year
Flip the narrative - you CHOSE impact over income this year

**Structure:**
1. Hook: 14% → 20% investment
2. List: 3-4 grouped categories (not 9 items)
3. Insight: Why experiential matters
4. Reframe: "I chose trajectory over cash flow"
5. Result: Specific ripple effects
6. CTA: Specific offer (year-end goal calls?)

### Option B: Focus on ROI
Make it about future returns, not current sacrifice

**Structure:**
1. Hook: 14% → 20% investment
2. Thesis: Best investment is always yourself
3. List: 3-4 key areas
4. Insight: Why this compounds
5. Evidence: Specific results (40+ builders, new skills)
6. CTA: What will you invest in?

---

## Quick Wins

### Immediate Fixes (Do These First):
1. Fix all grammar/typos listed above
2. Make arrows consistent (pick → or ✚, not both)
3. Remove "I guess" and ":D"
4. Change "Anyways" to stronger CTA
5. Decide: "Equivically" → "Ironically" or cut the line entirely

### Structure Improvements:
1. Group list into 3-4 categories:
   - Mind/Emotional (mentor, breathwork, qi gong)
   - Body (climbing, dance, improv)
   - Business (coaching, community-building, MOMENTUM)
   - Spirit (nature retreats, ceremonies)

2. Reframe the "low income" section:
   - Either own it proudly OR cut it
   - Don't apologize and assert simultaneously

3. Strengthen ending:
   - Pick one message (trajectory shift OR ROI)
   - Add specific CTA (year-end goal calls from previous post?)

## Detailed Score Breakdown

### Current Draft Score: 68-72/100

#### Hook Strength: 20/25
- **What's Working:**
  - Specific percentages (14% → 20%) are concrete and surprising
  - Opening with a bold financial commitment grabs attention
  - Clear thesis: "our impact + income grows when we do"

- **What's Hurting:**
  - Grammar issues in opening undercut credibility
  - Could be stronger with context (e.g., "Most people spend 0%...")

#### Storytelling Flow: 10/20
- **What's Working:**
  - List format is scannable
  - Shows breadth of investment
  - Progression from investment → insight → results makes sense

- **What's Hurting:**
  - 9 separate items (7 arrows + 2 plus signs) overwhelm reader
  - No clear grouping or categories
  - Transition from list to "This is not about knowing more" is abrupt
  - Ending jumps around: experiential → no F*ck You money → trajectory → low income → ROI
  - Missing connective tissue between ideas

#### Authentic Voice: 13/15
- **What's Working:**
  - "cringe", "SMH", ":D" feel genuinely you
  - Specific details (5.12s climbing, 5 decades mentor, Qi Gong) add authenticity
  - Vulnerable about low income year

- **What's Hurting:**
  - Tonal whiplash: confident → apologetic → confident
  - "I may not have" + "I guess" weaken your message
  - Sounds defensive rather than proud of choices

#### Audience Resonance: 11/15
- **What's Working:**
  - Personal growth investment resonates with founders/builders

#### Offer Integration: 5/10
- **What's Working:**
  - MOMENTUM Builders mentioned naturally (40+ sharp/driven builders)
  - Ties personal investment to your work

- **What's Hurting:**
  - "40+ builders that joined my sprints" - unclear if this is YOUR investment or their investment in you

  - Missed opportunity to connect dots for readers

#### Call to Action: 4/10
- **What's Working:**
  - "Invest in Yourself" is clear and actionable

- **What's Hurting:**
  - "Anyways" dismisses everything you just said
  - Generic CTA—no specific action to take
  - No connection to your year-end goal-setting calls from Nov 4 post
  - Missed opportunity: "Want help setting growth goals for 2026? DM me"

#### Visual/Format: 5/5
- **What's Working:**
  - List format is easy to scan
  - Arrow symbols create visual hierarchy
  - Line breaks make it readable
  - Photo + inspo credits are clear

## V2 Reassessment (Hook + Bridge Revised)

### Updated Score: 72-76/100 (+4 points)

### What Improved ✓

#### Hook Strength: 22/25 (+2 points)
**Before:** "This year I spent 14% of my income on personal growth. And I'm budgeting 20% for 2026!"
**After:** "I spend 14% of my 2025 income on personal growth. And I'm budgeting $20,000 for next year!"

**Improvements:**
- ✓ **14% → $20,000** creates escalating commitment (percentage → concrete dollar)
- ✓ **"I spend"** (present tense) feels more confident than "I spent"
- ✓ **Removed weak thesis from hook** ("Because if I know one thing...")
- ✓ **Cleaner, punchier** - two sentences instead of three

**Remaining Issues:**
- ⚠️ Extra space after "growth." (typo: "growth.   And")
- ⚠️ "$20,000 for next year" is clear but could be "$20,000 in 2026" for parallelism with "2025 income"

#### Storytelling Flow: 12/20 (+2 points)
**What improved:**
- ✓ **"Because if I know one thing..."** moved later in the post (better placement)
- ✓ **Bridge is cleaner** - no unnecessary explanation upfront
- ✓ **Thesis comes AFTER showing investments** (more powerful)

**Remaining Issues:**
- ⚠️ List is still overwhelming (9 items: 7 arrows + 2 plus signs)
- ⚠️ Ending still jumps around (F*ck You money → trajectory → thesis → ripple effects → low income → ROI)
- ⚠️ "It will have tremendous ripple effects" is vague (what ripple effects?)

### What Still Needs Work ⚠️

#### 1. Hook Micro-Issues
**Line:** "I spend 14% of my 2025 income on personal growth.   And I'm budgeting $20,000 for next year!"

**Issues:**
- Extra spaces before "And" (formatting glitch)
- "2025 income" + "next year" creates timeline confusion (are we in 2025 or looking back?)

**Fix:**
```
I spent 14% of my 2025 income on personal growth.

Next year I'm budgeting $20,000.

Here are all the coaches + experiences I've invested in:
```

**OR (if you want present tense):**
```
I spend 14% of my income on personal growth.

In 2026, I'm budgeting $20,000.

Here's where every dollar goes:
```

#### 2. The "F*ck You Money" Section Still Feels Defensive

**Lines:**
- "I may not have turned this AI gold rush into F*ck You money."
- "But I certainly shifted my trajectory by several degrees upwards."
- "Because if I know one thing it's that our impact + income grows when we do!"
- "It will have tremendous ripple effects throughout the rest of my life."
- "Equivocally, it was the lowest income year since I moved to Canada."
- "So, I guess the lifetime ROI of my 2025 must be MASSIVE! :D"

**Problems:**
1. **"I may not have"** - apologetic qualifier
2. **"F*ck You money"** - brings up money you DIDN'T make (defensive)
3. **"AI gold rush"** - no context (why mention this?)
4. **"Equivocally"** - unclear meaning here (does this mean "ambiguously"? or "paradoxically"?)
5. **"I guess"** - weakens your conviction
6. **":D"** - emoticon feels out of place for LinkedIn

**Tone:** Confident → Apologetic → Confident → Apologetic → Confident (whiplash)

**Fix Option 1: Own It Proudly**
```
This is not about knowing more! It's about shifting habits, mindset, and patterns.

It's about finding your zones of genius and reassembling your best parts.

That's why most of it is experiential, because it's how I learn best and how my growth actually lasts.

Because if I know one thing it's that our impact + income grows when we do!

I chose trajectory over cash flow this year.

And the lifetime ROI? It's already showing up.

Want help setting your own growth goals for 2026? DM me—I'm giving away free year-end goal-setting calls over the next 10 days.

**Fix Option 2: Cut the Defensive Part Entirely**
```
This is not about knowing more! It's about shifting habits, mindset, and patterns.

It's about finding your zones of genius and reassembling your best parts.

That's why most of it is experiential, because it's how I learn best and how my growth actually lasts.

Because if I know one thing it's that our impact + income grows when we do!

Most businesses are disguised personal growth projects.

They only grow when we do.

That's why I'm offering free year-end goal-setting calls to help you invest in yourself for 2026. DM me if you want one.
```

---

#### 3. CTA Is Still Weak

**Current:** "Anyways, Invest in Yourself!"

**Problems:**
- "Anyways" dismisses everything you just said
- Generic advice, no specific action
- No connection to your year-end goal calls offer from Nov 4 post

**Fix:**
```
Want help planning your own personal growth investments for 2026?

I'm giving away free year-end goal-setting calls over the next 10 days.

DM me if you want one.
