I'm giving away 20 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐞 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫-𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐠𝐨𝐚𝐥-𝐬𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐬 to celebrate the official launch of MOMENTUM.

The biggest needle-mover for 38 of the 40 founders, intrapreneurs, and changemakers in my sprints:

Every time I open LinkedIn, someone I'd least expect just shipped an AI agent, custom GPT, or automation workflow.

I love the builder enthusiasm. The energy is invigorating!

But I also see too many projects die in the messy middle, written off as "just for learning".

If you're putting in all the effort, why not aim for cash flow, a promotion, or a new job?

It's the same struggle I faced multiple times when going from idea to real-life impact over the last four years.

Fortunately, every time I had to admit failure and kill one of my start-up ideas, I got brutally honest with myself and documented my lessons.

I kept iterating on my German-engineered system to test ideas 0-1 and validate their potential.

This spring, right after solo-paddling the stunning Desolation Sound, it clicked.

I felt a real shift, even though I no longer had technical partners, just some AI agents.

I found paying customers before building anything.

I vibe-coded features people actually wanted.

I killed bad ideas without any emotional attachment.

When I baked all my learnings into MOMENTUM, other builders saw the same results immediately.

Within 5 weeks, builders landed their first paying customer, validated new features or pivots with real feedback, and killed bad ideas lightning fast!

Together, we're proving that not only can anyone build with AI now, but also turn (learning) projects into cash-flowing businesses.

So, what about you?

Got a 2025 dream you aren't living? An idea you haven't built? A move you haven't made?

I'm restructuring my calendar next week to connect with builders ready to close that gap between where they're today and where they wanna be in 61 days (i.e., at the end of the year).

DM me if you wanna to jump on a call.

You'll leave with clear year-end goals and an immediate impact on your trajectory. 🔥
