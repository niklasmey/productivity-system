By Sep 12, 15+ solo builders and I set out to make more progress than most all year!

We're all building for different reasons — but for me, this sprint gotta work out.

After 2+ years of building, stepping out of one venture, and betting on the split hypothesis … my runway's getting short.

Revenue would be ideal. Funding feels out of reach. Part-time consulting might be necessary.

So here's my commitment for the next 6 weeks:

100 founding users for my vibe-coded AI sizing engine
- Re-calibrate AI models with anonymous, granular fit profiles
- Solve hairy problems around security, privacy, and data pipelines

+ Four distribution experiments
- Post a Linkedin build-along series, woven into a new website
- Warm up new IG/TikTok accounts, post 15+ UGC shorts & 15+ carousels

And here's the German-engineered system we're using to make it happen:

#1 We put progress over perfection!

#2 We set clear goals that scare us a little but are achievable by Sep 12!

#3 We break it down, make it trackable, and set a sustainable pace!

#4 We lock it in with:
- WhatsApp accountability group
- 1:1 support from me every Friday
- Public demo day celebrating our progress

We've got 3 spots left!

Applications close at midnight.

Next cohort isn't until Sep 19!

DM me if you want in!

If you were in, what's something slightly scary YOU could create in 6 weeks?

Drop a 🔥 to support the crew!

Escape velocity is near,
Keep chiseling!
