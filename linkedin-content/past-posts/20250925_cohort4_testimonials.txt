Cohort #4 of my 6-week Sprints starts in just 4 days! What started as a small community project is becoming the foundation for the distributed tech studio I've dreamed of for years.

For me, it's about more than the structure, peer support, and shared accountability I wish I had when I started my founder journey.

It's about the new pathways that emerge when a group of sharp, driven founders come together, building for deep impact with AI.

But let's hear it in their words:

"It helped me gain momentum. Before, I was losing it, almost abandoning my project. Now, I have clarity and take immediate action week after week."

"Nik's focus on self-reflection, positivity, and authenticity helps me stay mindful, experiment more, and set better goals."

"The shared accountability combined with his fast, efficient, and clean approach made me far more productive than I could've been on my own."

Connecting with these founders fires me up to execute my vision relentlessly and make undeniable, compounding progress week after week.

Cohort #4 is capped at 10 seats, which are almost all gone at this point.

6 weeks (Sep 29 to Nov 7) is all it can take to:
• Ship a functional prototype you can actually test
• Refine your product and messaging with real feedback
• Crack your first distribution channel.

This is for founders who are serious about building, shipping, and making an impact!

P.S. Nothing beats the gratitude I feel after a 6-week Sprint where I fully committed and showed up for my dreams.
