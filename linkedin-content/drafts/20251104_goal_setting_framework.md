## Draft

Setting sprint goals with 40 builders taught me: if your goal feels too ambitious, it's just a wish!

And 38 out of 40 builders said setting objectives and key results was their biggest unlock.

Here's what turned wishes into goals:

❌ "Launch my MVP" → Sounds ambitious, but unmeasurable = wish

✅ "Get 5 people to pay $50 before I build anything" → Specific, scary, measurable = goal

The difference? You can't hide behind the second one.

Goals must be measurable so you can't hide behind them.

Real goals point your arrow—you know exactly where you're going and whether you got there.

---

Every sprint, we set one objective and three key results depending on what validation stage you're at:

**Objective** = Next validation stage you need to reach

**Key Results** = The evidence you need to accept it's real

This builds confidence you're moving in the right direction.

Failing on an objective two sprints in a row? That's proof killing it is the right decision—regardless of any emotional attachment.

---

But here's where it gets tricky: the goal also has to be the right level of scary.

Set goals too low? You curb progress.

Set goals too high? You burn out.

When you hit goals consistently, you stay motivated. You keep showing up.

When you miss goals repeatedly, doubt creeps in. You start wondering if it's worth it.

The best builders set slightly scary yet realistic goals—ambitious enough to matter, achievable enough to maintain staying power.

Choose the right level of hard, so you enjoy playing the game until all your efforts pay off.

Knowing what matters is more important than knowing how to do it.

Commit to the what, stay flexible about the how.

### So what do real goals look like?

Here are examples from active MOMENTUM builders in our Sep 29 - Nov 7 sprint:

**Objective: Research & Build Prototype**

• Key result #1: Study current solutions/workarounds

• Key result #2: Interview 10 unbiased target users

• Key result #3: Vibe-code MVP

**Objective: Prove Traction**

• Key result #1: Define channel + avatar + offer/product

• Key result #2: Test 1-2 high-performing formats per week

• Key result #3: Build initial community of 100 fans (content + outbound)

**Objective: Prove Financial Viability**

• Key result #1: Drive 10,000 landing page visits

• Key result #2: Increase conversion rate from 1% to 2%

• Key result #3: Acquire $2,000 in new MRR

I used to set goals like "build a great product" or "launch my startup."

Took me 6 years to realize: those aren't goals. They're wishes.

Your goal should make you slightly uncomfortable to say out loud.

If it doesn't, it's not ambitious enough.

If you can't measure whether you hit it, you're hiding.

Got a 2025 dream you aren't living? An idea you haven't built? A move you haven't made?

We're 61 days away from the end of the year.

Don't set wishes.

Set slightly scary, totally measurable goals that point your arrow in a direction that actually matters.

**What's a goal you've been setting that might be letting you hide?**

(Asking because I've been there.)
