6 months ago, I was ready for a break from entrepreneurship. My goal was a big boy job! But with my subversiveness on an all-time high, what actually happened blew my mind. 🤯

Here's the 5-𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤 I'd use (again) to step-change my career:

#1 Skip any job application

Unless you've strong social ties, applications disappear in the AI-filter void.

They may just be busywork disguised as progress.

Stop polishing your resume. Stop customizing cover letters. Stop the endless interview prep.

#2 Build something they can't ignore

Forget about your credentials, just execute in public!

Pick one:
• Create a productized service out of your domain expertise
• Vibe-code a tool solving one personal pain point
• Build a community that energizes its members

Commit to a slightly scary yet realistic goal around it.

Surprise yourself with how much skill you can acquire by actually doing the thing.

#3 Become hyper vocal

Post your highs, lows, and learnings consistently on LinkedIn.

Don't overthink it or aim for thought leadership. Just let the internet see your work.

It's not about views or followers either. It's proof you can execute.

Test ideas through outbound commenting. Double down on what drives engagement.

#4 Outbound-max LinkedIn

Request 150-200 new LinkedIn connections every week.

The key: Pick the right people! Those already commenting on posts in your niche.

Send every new connection a 3-part welcome message, like this:
• Hey {xxx}! Great to connect.
• Saw your interest in {vibe-coding}!
• What do you think about {Claude}?

Get to know them. Be real. Ask for feedback on what you're building.

#5 Pitch with high agency

Don't ask for permission. Anticipate problems, solve them, and show your value-add.

Find arbitrage opportunities and leverage your outbound-maxing strategy.

You don't have to be a 17-year-old GenZ to get the attention you deserve.

𝐂𝐚𝐯𝐞𝐚𝐭:

You may become unemployable! 🚨

And, discover that making enough money off of what you built is far easier, more freeing, and generally meaningful …

Than working for one of your dream employers.

At least that's what happened to me!

𝐖𝐡𝐲?

I committed to reclaiming agency over my professional life.

With relentless focus, I leveled up my vibe-coding and community-building skills.

Knowing they're crucial for next years, every project became an experiment toward mastery.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐝?

Now, I'm raising funds for my AI shopping companion.

Imagine an AI that eliminates all the guesswork when shopping clothes online.

Just chat through every sizing, style, and fit question before you click "buy".

Public access to the beta size-suggester agent is dropping on Monday.

𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐝𝐢𝐝 𝐈 𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐦𝐲 MOMENTUM?

I started hosting sprints for solopreneurs, vibe-coders, and career transformers to build alongside each other.

The next cohort starts Nov 17.

Doors open in 2 weeks.
