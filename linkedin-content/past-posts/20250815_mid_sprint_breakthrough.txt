Ah! The mid-sprint breakthrough feels sooo good:
🔥 Shipped my new personal website
🔥 Set up a Distribution Challenge for founders
🔥 Got out to climb somewhere pretty

This is my third 6-week sprint, but the first where I wasn't building alone.

15+ other founders joined me, and honestly?

I'm still going through the same emotional arc, but building alongside others completely changed how I deal with resistance.

The secret isn't just community and an active WhatsApp group!

It's taking a moment to reflect on your progress almost daily and having others see you for it.

Although I got all of them to share their reflections in our Friday 1:1, I gotta admit that I've only shared mine once.

🤦Asking others to be vulnerable but withholding myself ..

Time to step out!

So from now on, I'll post them here as well. Let's go!

**Highs**
- Built my new personal website, prototyping with Lovable and shipping with Framer
- Prepared a 6-week Distribution Challenge together with Superscale AI
- Scaled my AI sizing plug-in to 10,000+ size vectors, vibe-coding with Anthropic's Claude Code in Microsoft's VS Code

**Low**
- Working until 2am Tuesday night out of pure excitement, derailing my sleep hygiene for the rest of the week

**Learnings**
- After burning through all the negativity from my past, I was searching for my new fuel source! Now, I've found it in the people greatness attracts.
- My 6-week Sprints and soon Distribution Challenges deserved a proper brand (s/o to Selina Huber for accidentally choosing MOMENTUM)

**Action items**
[ ] Kick off my Distribution Challenge on Aug 27
[ ] Start posting on IG/TikTok @letnikexplore
- My 2nd distribution experiment this sprint
- I'm lowkey scared …
[ ] Vibe-code, vibe-code, and vibe-code
- Can't wait to see my AI sizing plug-in getting some real use

**Blocker**
"Failing forward" for 3 years without a venture blowing up challenged my self-worth.

The brutal truth: I didn't believe anyone would actually pay for my work, no matter how great it was.

My mentors, peer feedback, and getting real honest finally had me rewrite that story.

After all, businesses grow when we do, and how you do one thing is how you do everything.

Time to test the new narrative.

Happy days,
Nik
