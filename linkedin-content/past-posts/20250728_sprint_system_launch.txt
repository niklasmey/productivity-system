3 months ago, I felt stuck as a solo builder! I was working hard but going nowhere..

Then I found a way to build real momentum without burning out by running 6-week sprints, building alongside other sharp and driven entrepreneurs.

In the process, I've German-engineered the system I wish I had 10 years ago:

Show up, declare your actions, and stay in motion!

This Friday, we kick off our next 6-week sprint.

And, I invite 8 more builders to join us!

After this active rest week, we start again with setting our goal on Aug 1!

By Sep 12, you'll look back at real wins you thought would take months!

Here's what you get when you join:
- Weekly 1:1 calls to set and reflect on your goals
- WhatsApp group with 10+ fellow builders
- 2 group calls to celebrate our progress
- Unlimited text + voice support
- A little gift when you finish

And, it's free! So what are you waiting for?

What could you create in 6 weeks with momentum that compounds?

…

Really think about it!

…

DM me to lock in your spot!
- Tag a friend/partner to join together.

Escape velocity is near,
Keep chiseling,
Nik

P.S. This is a great fit for my fellow hashtag#lovableshipped s1 builders who want to keep going! Lovable
