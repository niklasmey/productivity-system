72 hours from Antler, 100 credits from Lovable, and 3 cortados later = 1 new feature built!

It's a tool that instantly decodes Aritzia's shipping and return policies based on any shopper's location.

The problem: Throughout 5,000+ conversations with strangers about shopping habits, I kept hearing the same tiny frustration.

Instead of faster deliveries, people wanted to know:
• When will their item arrive?
• How long do they have to try it on?

Buying a new piece of clothing online, feeling it out at home, and deciding about it is a whole experience that has to fit in with everything else going on.

So they'd study shipping + return policies or click all the way to checkout just to find these answers.

I always thought this workaround was too small to underpin a viable product.

But who has time for all those clicks or walls of text in 2025?

And why isn't this information provided upfront?

The solution: A dead-simple utility tool that gives shoppers these answers in under 2 seconds, no matter where they are or what Aritzia item got them excited.

Why build this? It opens up an additional GTM angle for my shopping companion, giving me more distribution options and leverage for future experiments.

See the lead capture play around sending them return reminders on the third screen.

Thanks McKenzie Hagan and Brenton Andersen for having us! :)
