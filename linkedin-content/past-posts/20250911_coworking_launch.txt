Our MOMENTUM coworking sessions are LIVE! 🔥💥

After two failed startups, I made myself a promise: I'd maintain the conviction, focus, and relentless execution required in the early days!

But the brutal reality of starting a business kicked in fast and I was flailing …

So I started experimenting. Invited friends to cowork at my place. Tried different accountability setups. Re-read all the books. Attended startup challenges and vibe-coding competitions.

What emerged? MOMENTUM

Right now, 16 early-stage founders are building their products alongside each other in our core program, a 6-week Sprint.

But building without distribution is not enough!

So today, Daniela Redding and I launched something in addition: A weekly ritual, carving out focused time to actually execute on our marketing ideas.

Together, we form a tight group that gathers every Wednesday to:
• Create content alongside each other
• Master a principle of influence
• Tackle a micro-challenge
• Share feedback and wins!

Our builds? Travel companions, AI search platforms, health apps, company offsite services, salary negotiation coaches, 3D printing subscriptions, and more.

Our goals? Launch in 6 weeks, not 6 months. Post consistently, despite the discomfort. Grow our waitlist predictably.

Unified by a commitment to MOMENTUM

Because we're done dreaming!
